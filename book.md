## Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice
*Sep 1, 2013*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=13)] 

1 Sam 15:22 “Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams”

SAUL

1 Samuel 15 explains why the first king of Israel (king Saul) lost his kingdom. God told him to defeat the Amalekites and “utterly destroy them and all they have” (v3). He didn’t do that. Instead, he defeated the Amalekites but spared their king, and spared many nice goods that they had with a plan to sacrifice them to the Lord. The worst part was, he thought that he was pleasing God by doing this! (v17). He must have felt so proud with an intention to sacrifice all those nice things to God. But then Samuel the prophet came along with a surprising rebuke – “obedience is better than sacrifice” (v22). We go on to read that this is when God decided to take away the kingdom from Saul.

A MISCONCEPTION OF WHAT IT IS TO PLEASE GOD

Like Saul, it’s possible that we can have a wrong concept of what’s pleasing to God and what isn’t. It’s possible that we are laboring in this Christian life to live for God in a way that isn’t the best and may even be disobedient altogether. In this Christian “race” we are running, we should be sure we are running toward the right goal. We should be much more focused on the goal of obeying God (inwardly from the heart), rather than sacrificing many things to Him (externally with many works).

EXAMPLES

Inward obedience is what God wants us to focus on. If we have a terribly angry heart, God would rather have us focus on being delivered from anger than to set ourselves to read the Bible an hour every day. How many Christians set themselves to be delivered from anger? I don’t know the number but I’m pretty sure it’s far less than the number who commit to reading the Bible daily! There’s no command from God to read the Bible daily, but Ephesians 4:30 tells us to put away all wrath. That’s an example of God desiring inward obedience over outward sacrifice.

If we have been living this Christian life for any period of time, chances are we’ve attempted to please God in many different ways like this. And we may have felt for a time that we were pleasing Him by doing many works. We may have felt very “productive” evangelizing and spreading the gospel, proving unbelievers wrong, tithing, serving five days a week in church, sticking to a prayer list… and many other external things. And not all these things are bad. Many of them are good. But what a pity if for so many years we’ve been most excited about those things and missed the thing that God wants us to focus on most; inward obedience of the heart - where we are progressing in the Christian life and our hearts are becoming more and more to be like Jesus' heart. (1 John 3:3). “And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.”

It’s better to pursue humility, than to be a proud evangelist. It’s better to seek God for deliverance of a hateful heart toward some brothers and sisters in church than to serve them with a hidden bitterness. It’s better to give only a little money to the church, but be ‘rejoicing in the Lord always’ than to give a large bag of money every month, but at the same time have constant dissatisfaction with God and the Christian life.

DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN INWARD OBEDIENCE AND OUTER SACRIFICE

I’m not sure why I have so often in the past had a wrong conception of what really pleases God. The Bible makes it very clear that God is not focused on the external but the internal:

(Romans 14:17) “The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”

(1 Samuel 16:7) “God does not look on the outward appearance but on the heart.”

(Matthew 23:26) “First clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.”

(Hosea 6:6) “I desire mercy, not sacrifice”

(1 Samuel 15:22) “To obey is better than sacrifice”

(Psalm 51:16-17) “For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering. 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.”

I suppose that for myself it has been very easy to miss it, because in the past I have judged a successful Christian life by what looks ‘productive’ and the concrete results I could see. But as I am growing in the Lord and getting to know His heart, I am seeing more that what is admirable in His eyes is not what is admirable in the eyes of men (Isaiah 55:8-9). Men look at ‘results’ (sacrifice), but God looks on the heart (inward obedience).

Going back to the example of king Saul – if we read the chapter carefully we can see that the problems of his inward heart were the cause of his downfall:

(1 Sam 15:17) Samuel said, "Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel

(1 Sam 15:24) Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.

Verse 17 makes it clear that king Saul once had humility (he once was little in his own eyes), but then lost it and became proud. Verse 24 makes it clear that he was a slave to the fear of men. His inward sins of the heart (pride, and the fear of men) were ultimately caused his downfall. No outward sacrifice could make up for this. He would have done much better to judge himself inwardly and work with God on that first, rather than focusing on doing so many things for God. And we would too.

FREEDOM FROM GUILT

A wonderful benefit I have gained from this truth which has brought much joy to my walk with the Lord is that since God is not as concerned about these outward things, that I don’t have to feel guilty if I am not able to keep them up as I’d like. I don’t have to condemn myself if I’ve missed my morning time in the Word, or if I forgot to pray for a brother or sister. What a joy to see that God is so easy on us! This freedom from guilt and condemnation in these areas helps me to focus with more joy on cleansing myself inwardly. Unlike Martha, we don’t have to feel like we have to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders so that we can be “productive” for the Lord (Luke 10:40-42). We can joyfully live in the freedom that God is not pressing all these things on us – always telling us “do more, do more, do more, not good enough, not good enough.” He wants us to spend our energy and our thoughts on obedience in the inward life.

To clarify - it's not that we should be undisciplined in our devotional time with the Lord, or be unproductive for the Lord. But in His eyes, if we focus more on cleansing ourselves inwardly then we will actually be much more productive for Him! How is that possible? It’s possible because in God’s eyes a pure widow’s penny is worth much more than a proud Pharisee’s bag of money (Luke 21:1-4). Our small works done for God with the right heart are worth much more to Him than many works done with inward sins – wrong attitudes, pride and such things.

Do your best, but don’t compare yourself to anybody, and don’t see God as looking down on you with disappointment over these things if you fall short. Jesus came to “set the captives free.” (Luke 4:18) God meant to set us free from sin, but He also meant to set us free from guilt! Don’t forget to claim God’s promise of freedom from sin without also claiming freedom from guilt, or you may find the Christian life very burdensome and discouraging. Jesus said, “Come to me all you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). If your walk with God is not restful, then you must be carrying some false weight which God does not want you to carry.

THE CHURCH GOAL

I am thankful that I have been blessed with many brothers and sisters who I believe have this same goal (of cleansing ourselves inwardly), who are in my church. It helps me to keep focused on this same goal. And I really didn’t get this goal until I was in fellowship with such people.

I’m not sure if our church family considers ourselves to have a list of ‘church verses’ which define us, but if we did, it would definitely contain Romans 8:29 – “For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son."

The goal which we are aiming to run toward is cleansing ourselves inwardly so that we will be conformed to the image of Jesus. We believe that evangelism is good, and helping the poor is good, and serving the church is good, and giving money is good... But we are most excited about inward purity and obedience to God in our hearts. I believe this is what it means to focus on obedience rather than sacrifice. I encourage everyone to fellowship with the people who have a passion for this same goal, and not primarily on external things which many churches these days can be occupied with.


# Chapter Two
## Hearing God In The Unclear Times
*Oct 1, 2013*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=14)] 

Like Jesus who came to do the will of His Father (Jn 6:38), a Christian who is whole-hearted will be most serious in life about accomplishing God’s will. God’s *primary* will for us is clear – to become like Christ (Rom 8:29). This means we strive to overcome sin because it grieves God, and we strive to put on the character of Christ – devotion to the Lord, love for others, humility, the fruits of the Spirit, etc. We do this because this is what pleases God and that is our main goal in life because we love Him.

This is God’s primary will and it is clear. But there are many other areas in life and decisions we have to make where God’s will for our lives may not be so clear. We desire to make the right choice and we pray about these things and try as best as we can to follow the voice of the Holy Spirit – which many times can prove very difficult. There are many really important situations in life where we run into this –things like deciding where to live, who to marry, which church family to commit to, which ministry to serve in, which career path to take, which job to take and even more so the many daily decisions we have to make such as how to deal with a particular situation, how to respond to people in difficult times, or what we should be doing with our free time.

Hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit has not been an easy thing for myself. And looking back I’ve seen how what I think is the voice of the Holy Spirit many times may not be. How can we walk with God when we’re not always sure what He’s saying to us?

I don’t have all the answers for how to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and I don’t want to try to list out methods in this article, but instead wanted to share one huge encouragement that God has shown me in these ‘unclear’ situations. The encouragement is to remember that God is a loving Father, who is merciful and easy on me. He’s more concerned about cleansing my inner character than by me discerning what the correct path is in a particular situation. As I walk with Him to cleanse my heart, the external path will become clearer.

In the Old Testament, David was generally a good king who wanted to please God. And he wanted to show his devotion by building a temple for God. God soon spoke to David and said it was not His will for David to do that, but what was most encouraging to me about this is to read what God said about David after this:

**2 Chronicles 6:8***But the**Lord**said to my father David, **‘Because it was******in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was******in your heart.****9**Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.’*

Even though God’s will was that David would not build the house, God was still pleased with David because he had it in his heart to do this act of love for the Lord. How is it that David intended to do something which wasn’t God’s will, but God was still pleased with him?! That seems contradictory, but it’s not. It’s because David’s primary goal was not to please himself, but to please God. And David was quick to follow God’s will once God made it clear to him. He wanted to please God when he intended to build the temple, and he equally wanted to please God when God told him not to build it.

What a wonderful joy to see how God looks at us! What a loving Father. We make many mistakes in life. We make many unwise decisions. The main thing is to maintain a heart of devotion to the Lord so that even in our mistakes of mishearing God He can say “Nevertheless, you did well that you wanted to please me.” I see it as a little boy who makes a mess of the garage trying to make his Dad a complicated birthday gift with scrap wood and a bunch of tools. Even though he shouldn’t have made a mess and used his tools without asking, his Dad will still look at him with a loving smile because he knows that his intention was to show his love. The boy still has perfect fellowship with his Dad and he can go clean up his mess with a happy heart.

One thing I’ve been guilty of in the past is ‘paralysis by analysis’. Sometimes being afraid to make a decision because of the fear that it’s not God’s will and so I can tend to be stuck in a position where I don’t do anything. This truth of God as a loving Father has helped me with that problem. It reminds me of a certain quote that has helped me for years – “A ship which is heading in the wrong direction can be turned around quicker than one which is sitting stationary.” This is the idea that we should pray and be patient, but we shouldn’t wait forever to take action because we are paralyzed with fear. Move forward with the best understanding of God’s will that we have, with the peace of knowing that as long as we are fully submitted to Him with an intention to please Him, He can turn us around if we are at any point headed in the wrong direction.

So in all these unclear situations in our life, we can take heart in the fact that God is a loving Father. Let’s focus most on cleansing our selfishness, our sinful motives and evil intentions of the heart, and putting on the character of Christ. Once this is done then these other matters will fall into place as long as we have a humble heart which is willing to try to do as best as we can what we believe God is telling us to do, and to submit to God as His will becomes clearer to us. For now, I may or may not be hearing clearly... only let me do my best to make sure I am trying to please God and not myself.


# Chapter Three
## Losing Our Lives For Jesus' Sake
*Jan 1, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=16)] 

THE STORY OF JOSEPH

At one time in their lives Joseph’s brothers were driven by jealousy to throw him into a pit, and to sell their young brother into slavery for life. But many years passed and at the end of the story you find the same brothers willing to sacrifice their own lives for the sake of their father Jacob (Gen 44:33-34). Somewhere along the way something in them changed. They went from being people who were willing to kill their own brother for the sake of exalting themselves, to selfless people who were willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their father. I believe their story illustrates the progression of the Christian life. It’s a life that starts out full of the self-life wanting to ‘save’ our own lives, but after coming to the Lord progresses toward “death to self” - a selflessness which is willing to lay down our lives for the sake of our Father in Heaven, and also for others. This is greatest type of love that we can ever have.

**John 15:13** *“Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.”*

LAYING DOWN OUR LIVES

I would personally equate the idea of laying down my own life with ceasing from laboring for my own happiness and instead live only to make God happy. It’s quite a paradox that this actually is the *most* happy Christian life – that the only way to have true joy in the Lord is by giving up ambitions for our own happiness and instead be totally occupied with pleasing our loving Father. I believe this is what Jesus means when He says *“Whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”* (Mat 16:25).

EXAMPLES FROM THE BIBLE

Mary had this godly quality of disregarding herself for the sake of God. In Luke 1:38 Mary said, “Behold, the bond-slave of the Lord, may it be done unto me according to your word.” Mary was on the path of “death to self.” She would suffer much hardship in life, and eventually she would have to lose her beloved child, watching Him die on the cross. But she basically said to God, “I accept whatever you have for me. I am an unworthy slave existing only for you Lord, do with me what you like.” I’m not surprised that God chose Mary out of all the women on Earth to be the Mother of Jesus.

Daniel’s 3 friends also had this attitude (Daniel 3:17-18) when they were about to be thrown into the fire for their faith. They basically said, “God is in complete control. He can save us if He wants but whether He does or not that’s up to Him – may He do as He pleases. We only exist for Him and will not bow down to anybody else.” These were selfless men, happy to lay down their lives and suffer if that’s what God chose for them.

THE BEAUTY OF DEATH TO SELF

To the world this story may sound like a very sad story – they may see Christians as a bunch of people who have been given the gift of life but cannot enjoy it for themselves. But it’s quite the opposite view from a Heavenly perspective. In Heaven, a resigned life like this is the most beautiful thing. **1Pet 3:3****-4*****“****Your adornment must not be merely external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;**but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.**”* This verse is referring to what God sees as beautiful in a woman, but I believe the principle applies to all people. The principle is that God looks at the type of inner spirit a person has and sees beauty. A person who has died to themselves is the equivalent in God’s eyes to what physical beauty and attractiveness is to the world. The Holy Spirit is preparing a bride for Jesus, and this bride will be one which is adorned with a selfless heart – a gentle and quiet spirit (not loud and harsh because it is not fighting for itself anymore), and that has resigned itself for God’s sake. This is what God sees as beautiful.

TRIALS AND TRIBULATION

The worst tribulation in the world becomes much more peaceful when we have the attitude that “I am happy to accept whatever God chooses for me. If He is pleased to put me into some trial, or keep me in this affliction, then I am pleased to be here. May He do with me as He will, since His pleasure is the only thing that matters.” Like Job who said “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked I shall return there. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.” (Job 1:21) The important thing isn’t whether we are clothed or stripped in life, only that the name of the Lord is blessed. If our joy and peace comes from God's name being blessed rather than whether we are clothed or stripped, we will be the happiest people on Earth!

CONCLUSION

May we all be on the right path of resignation to our own lives. Moving from an attitude where we want to build a life for ourselves and hold on to our lives, to an attitude where we exist only for God’s pleasure. I believe this is what it means to be dead to ourselves but alive in Christ. Dead people have no ambition, plans, and eagerness for what can be gained for themselves. The whole world is toiling and fighting to build a good life for themselves. They are trying to build their own kingdom. Let’s be the few different people who don’t seek to build our own kingdom, but seek first our Father’s kingdom because we love Him more than ourselves. Every person on Earth will always labor for whatever his or her first love is. If we love ourselves most, then we will labor to build our own kingdom. But if God is our first love then we will build His kingdom.


# Chapter Four
## Investing Your Talents
*Mar 1, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=18)] 

I’ve known a man for many years who from what I’ve seen is full of natural grace. I’ve never seen him angry or anxious, he’s naturally very calm. He has a child, and I’ve seen his child get out of hand and I watched as he disciplined his child with much grace and without anger. He’s very generous – he doesn’t have much, but whatever he has he’s always quickly willing to share. He has a humble, caring attitude and I’ve seen him go out of his way to help people he didn’t even know. The odd thing about this situation is that this man is not a believer!

Sometimes it would to be pretty discouraging to me that a man who never even sought God would have so many godly qualities that I desired for myself, and he had them (what seemed like) without even trying. Why do I (who love God) struggle with sins that some unbelievers seem to deal with so naturally? Then I realized that God had a lesson for me about pleasing Him that I learned through knowing this man.

The lesson is that God is glorified *more* when we (by the power of the Holy Spirit) work to overcome sins that are in us than He would be if we never struggled with them at all. For example, if I was born with a temper and I by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit live in victory over my anger, God will be glorified much more than if I was never born with a temper at all!

This is like the parable of the talents in Matthew 25. To some people He’s given 1 talent, to others He’s given 2, and to others He’s given 5. A man that starts life with 5 talents and ends with 5 will bring no pleasure to the Lord in the end. But to the man who comes back with more than what he started with, God will be pleased – even if he ended with less than someone else! If I started out with 2 talents of ‘natural peace and patience’, and by the grace of God work hard to attain rest in Him and to overcome anxiousness, and then I end my life with 4 talents of peace and patience, what a testimony that will be for God on the last day! It will be an even better testimony than a man who started with 5 and ended with 5. But it would be tragic if I started my life anxious and ended it just as anxious and untrusting of God.

We all have our own sins and have more or less natural ability in certain areas than others. Don’t be discouraged when you struggle with a particular sin. The fact that you are in the struggle (and haven’t resigned yourself to just giving up, or chosen to ignore it) is itself pleasing to God. The fact that you don’t say “I was born like this, it’s just how I am” is an indicator of faith! Remember that God has a purpose for allowing this, and His purpose is that you would by His grace and power put your sin to death. It will turn out to be such a beautiful testimony as you make progress in it. Just don’t bury your talent, keep pressing on and gaining talents one by one!

When we strive to do this until the end of our life we will find ourselves far closer to the image of Christ than we were than when we first started out (we will have gained many more talents). I sometimes feel a voice hounding me "You'll never be 100% in the image of Christ while you are here on this earth." I've come to understand that as the voice of the devil trying to lower my aim in godliness and trying to prevent me from making progress. I must never lower my aim. I once heard a saying "If you don't aim for the stars, you'll never get to the moon." Lowering my aim is the equivalent of lowering my faith and it will hinder my progress into the image of Jesus. I should never, ever resign my aim to anything less than the perfect image of Jesus. Jesus said: "Be perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect” (Mat 5:48). In other words, I must keep pressing on to perfection (Heb 6:1), and leave the success of my progress in God's hands. God has given me a certain number of talents, and for my whole lifetime I must be diligent to gain as many as possible without worrying how quickly or slowly they are increasing. Remember what God says to the people who do this with their talents:

***Matt 25:23** 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.'*


# Chapter Five
## The Progression Of Peter'S Faith
*May 1, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=20)] 

In our church we’ve often defined faith as dependence and confidence in God. The opposite of this is confidence and dependence in ourselves.

I don’t believe we all start out with full of faith like this we should, but God helps us to mature in this area over time. Peter’s life demonstrates this. Let’s look at how God built Peter's faith into what it should be (dependence and confidence in God):

**1. Self Confidence**

Peter started out very self-confident: Matthew 26:33 “I will never leave you.” Pride and self-confidence is often marked by the words “I will…” The Bible says that we shouldn’t presume that we can do anything, but instead recognize that everything is in the power of God’s hands: James 4:15 says: “Instead, you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that."

Peter believed that he could muster up enough determination and courage to stand with Jesus until the end, without recognizing that he needed God’s grace to do it.

Needless to say, God soon allowed Peter to fall and to deny his Savior. With a single look from Jesus Peter then saw how incapable he was and how he hurt Him. That’s when his attitude changed:

*Luke 22:61-62: The Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly*.

In a moment, God broke Peter’s pride by allowing him to fall and then showing him what he had done. I don’t think that Jesus was condemning Peter with His look. I believe that with His look our Lord Jesus was saying “Peter, I don’t condemn you… but that really hurt me.” Peter saw that despite all of his past zeal and determination, he had failed and he had hurt his beloved Lord.

**2. Brokenness, Resignation**

Peter was so broken, that he decided to quit the ministry. “*I’m going to fish*” (John 21:3) In simple words, Peter quit. Peter went from the attitude of “I will” to “I can’t”. Peter saw that he was incapable of following Jesus like he thought he was. He resigned himself to be a failure at following the Lord. At least he was not proud anymore! But he was not where God wanted him yet. God does not want us proud, but He does not want us discouraged either.

**3. Reconciliation**

Now that Peter was at the end of himself, God showed how patient, loving and merciful He was toward him: (*Mark 16:7 - "But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.'"*) An angel spoke these words to some of the women who were disciples visiting Jesus’ tomb. It’s interesting that the angel specifically named Peter when telling them to relay the message. I believe this was God was showing Peter that He did not hold anything against him and that He still loved him. There was still hope! I believe through this single statement is where Peter saw God’s love, patience and mercy through this wonderful word that the women had passed on from the angel.

**4. True Faith**

Peter was not yet perfect, but he was able to live the rest of his life grounded in the fact that he could do nothing apart from the Father, no matter how determined he was in the flesh. Only then he was fit to pass on to others the lesson that God taught him: it’s nothing other than the patience of God that is our salvation (2 Peter 3:15). In other words “*it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.*” (Romans 9:16) This is the attitude of real faith– total dependence and confidence in God.

The challenge for us is to recognize that we can do nothing apart from our Lord Jesus (dependence - John 15:5), but we can do everything through Him (confidence - Philippians 4:13).


# Chapter Six
## Godliness In God'S Eyes Vs Godliness In Man'S Eyes
*Sep 3, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=22)] 

I was recently reminded of a very important principle that someone told me: “Any truth you find that brings you closer to Christ must work for a single mother of 5.” In other words, there are many good ideas that people have about how to live and draw near to God, but many of them are just theory that aren’t very practical to people living in the real world. What’s worse is that they are not in the Bible.

I’ve heard things said like “we need to pray for hours every day alone in our prayer closet away from everything and everyone”, “we need to consciously think about Jesus in every thought we have throughout the day”, “when we get saved we need to withdraw from everyone and go on a retreat for a month to get to know God”, “we need to read at least an hour of the Bible every day”, “we need to ask Jesus about every single decision we make, even down to the color shoes we wear and the type of breakfast we eat.” Can you imagine a single mother of 5 trying to do all these things? Nowhere in the Bible are any of these commanded and I believe the people who teach them are sincere, but they are making the Christian life more of a burden than a freedom for poor people who are trying to draw near to God but just can’t seem to keep up with all of these commands.

Godliness in the eyes of men often looks like those things listed above: doing many works EXTERNALLY that look spiritual.

*"These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence." (‭Colossians‬ ‭2‬:‭23‬ NASB)*

External spirituality looks godly, but the life of our Lord Jesus shows us that a truly godly life can look very normal. Jesus lived 33 years. He started His ministry at 30 years old, and before that He was a carpenter. So out of 33 years He spent only 10% (3 years) of those in ministry… the vast majority of the rest of those years he spent pounding nails and sawing wood! Is that really what a godly life looks like? Wouldn’t it have been better if instead of dealing with wood and furniture He started ministry early? Or at least withdrew from the world and lived like John the Baptist in the wilderness alone with God? No, Jesus was a regular man who lived a regular life like the rest of us. And still, after this surprisingly ordinary life that Jesus lived (before He did any ministry) God was able to say “this is my Son in whom I am well pleased” (Matt 3:17). What God sees as godly is far different than what man sees as godly (Isa 55:8-9).

The truth of the New Covenant is that God’s desire for us is not accomplished outwardly by many external means such as living like a monk or praying in a closet for many hours each day. It is a work of the Holy Spirit that is done inside of us as we take up our cross and deny ourselves, as we crucify our flesh, as we die to ourselves. *Every* person can do this, regardless of what they spend the majority of their time doing every day. The single mother of 5 can do this and so can a monk or a man living in the wilderness. Everybody can choose to deny their flesh when tempted with sin – either externally or in their thought life. This is how *any* person (in Christ) can be pleasing to God because it’s only when we die to ourselves that Jesus Christ can live in us and live a life that is pleasing to God through us.

*Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal (John 12:24-25)*

As the verse says, if we don’t die to ourselves, we remain alone (without Christ in us... living only on the merits of our own external righteousness). But if we die, then Jesus can live in us and live out true godliness… only then can we bear much fruit.

Jesus’ life is the only life that is pleasing to the Father. Praise God that we can be pleasing to Him too.. if we die to ourselves so that He can live inside of us. This (Jesus living inside of us) is the only way to please God… this is our only “hope of glory”:

*“that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is **Christ in you, the hope of glory.**” (Colossians 1:26-27)*

Our hope of eternal glory does not lie in praying for a certain amount of time every day, it’s not in reading our Bible every day, it’s not in withdrawing from the world, it’s not in self-discipline. Our Christian life does not depend on these things (though these can be good things). It depends on how much I am willing to surrender, die to myself, die to sin, and sacrifice of myself for the sake of Christ, so that He can live in me. This is our hope of glory – Jesus living inside of us.

*"Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me. "For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it." (Matthew 16:24-25)*

## Put On A Heart Of Compassion
*Oct 30, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=23)] 

**Col 3:12****“**So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, **put on a heart of compassion**, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience”

One time the disciples were walking with Jesus after being rejected by a group of Samaritans and the disciples asked Him, *"Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" But He turned and rebuked them, and said, ‘You do not know what kind of spirit you are of; for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.’"* (Luke 9:54-56 NASB)

Here the disciples had contempt for unbelievers and ungodly people. Surprisingly, Jesus said that the source of their contempt was not the Holy Spirit, but from the devil – “you do not know what kind of spirit you are of.”

Satan is the one who has the desire to see people destroyed, not God. Many times it's tempting to play into the devil's spirit thinking that we are "fighting for Jesus." Sometimes I've seen this type of spirit in myself and ignorantly given into this contempt. Sometimes like the disciples, I’ve felt that God would have been pleased to see certain people destroyed. People who have done wicked things toward God or toward me, or people who put down Christianity. This desire to see unbelievers destroyed is not the attitude of God, that’s the attitude of a demon. God is compassionate and patient, even with His enemies. And thankfully He is because after all, we were once His enemies! (Romans 5:10)

Paul must have known that there’s this natural tendency in our flesh to hate people, especially our enemies or people who are laboring against us or against the Lord. For example, the government. There are politicians who create and approve of terrible ungodly laws and try to push Christianity out of the country. There’s no shortage of ‘Christians’ who hate them and would like to see them destroyed! But that’s not the heart of God, it’s the spirit of the devil. That’s why Paul urged Timothy to pray for all people, even heathen rulers of the government! Because God is a compassionate God who desires for them to be saved (1 Timothy 2:1-4).

Like our merciful Father in Heaven, we must ‘put on a heart of compassion’. Let’s not have a zeal to fight the unbelievers, fight the government, fight the atheists, fight the world. Let’s be zealous to fight the sin within ourselves! People with that kind of godly zeal are very rare.


# Chapter Eight
## The Sin Of Immodesty
*Dec 4, 2014*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=24)] 

When we read about immodesty, most of us probably think about women and the kind of dress that they wear. Indeed, the Bible (e.g. 1 Timothy 2:9-10) specifically writes to address modesty in a woman’s dress. But I’ve realized that at the core of the sin of immodesty is an attitude which both men and women can be guilty of – that is the **desire to lift ourselves up in the eyes of others and in the eyes of ourselves**.

As a man I’ve seen that more than how I look in style and looks, the sin of ‘immodesty’ is manifested in how I speak – in what I say, in how I say it, and even in how much I say. Much of what I say can be said in such a way that in one way or another I can try to lift myself up in the eyes of others, much in the same way people change their appearance in order to stand out and have others notice them. We can be quick to look down at younger people in the church or those in the world who are eager to dress immodestly, and we can complain about the low moral standards today. But I think a lot fewer of us have seen the ugliness of immodesty in our speech and how we seek to draw attention to ourselves. When we see the ugliness of this same sin within ourselves, we will be quick to judge ourselves.

For example, seeking to gain credit for my work at the expense of putting down others is really just a temptation to lift myself up too (by pushing others down). There’s rarely a temptation to bluntly boast in plain words, but the temptation is to do it much more subtly so nobody else notices (and maybe I won’t even notice) that I’m trying to lift myself up. We want to subtly give the idea that we see things clearly at 30,000 feet when everyone else sees things at sea level!

Also, sometimes it’s not so much about specifically saying great things about myself as in the amount that I say. By dominating conversations with things that I have to say without being genuinely interested in what others have to say, I can be seeking to express to others that “I am interesting, and knowledgeable, you’ll want to hear what I have to say.” This can also be true in the church and in our holy activities, where we want to be thought of as knowledgeable about the Bible. We think that knowledge of the Bible is the highest calling of the Christian, and lets everyone know that we are spiritual. But the Bible says *“While knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church.” (1 Corinthians 8:1 - NLT)*

The drive of immodesty (in both men and women) is exactly the opposite of what John the Baptist meant when he said ‘I must decrease.’ The driving motivation behind immodesty is “I must increase, I must have people think about me, I must be noticed, I must have people think I am gifted and valuable.” I believe that if we see these things in our hearts and take them to the Lord for help, we will be able to walk in victory over this sinful attitude of immodesty. Why is there such a temptation to exalt ourselves in the eyes of others? As far as I can tell it’s because we have not clearly seen a few things:

**1.** **We have not seen the Lord’s true value, we have not seen Him “High and lifted up” (Isa 6:1).**

Just as a homeless man would never boast to a king how successful he is, the more I see the Lord ‘high and lifted up’, the less fit I will feel to declare myself high and lifted up. After Isaiah saw the Lord high and lifted up (Isa 6), the first thing he did was declare “Woe is me!” (v5). When we see God in the true light, we will not declare how high we are but how low we are and how high God is.

**2.** **We want to feel that we have value, but we have not seen the value we have in Christ**

The Lord gives us many great and precious promises telling us how much He cares for us and how much we mean to Him (for example, Isa 49:16 and Psalm 139:17-18). I believe as I grab ahold of those promises I will not feel the need to try to seek to make myself valuable outside of Christ.

**3.** **We have not seen how worthless the opinions of others are**

In the Bible we read verses like “What can man do to me?” (Heb 13:6), and “Don’t fear the one who can kill your body” (Matt 10:28), and again Jesus said to Pilate “You have no power over me except for that which has been given to you from above” (John 19:11). As long as our Father is happy with us, we don’t need to fear if everyone else is upset with us or looks down on us. They may be able to hurt our flesh but they can never steal our joy in the Lord and our eternal treasure we have in Jesus.

What a peaceful and joyous life that is to see our value in Christ and not in men! Let us pay close attention to how we speak, and repent quickly every time we find ourselves subtly lifting ourselves up in the eyes of others by our words. God will open our eyes to these things as we hate our sin and repent of it, and draw near to Him for help to be delivered from it.

## What Was Jesus Like
*Jan 7, 2015*

I sometimes wonder what Jesus was like during the 30 years He lived on the earth, before He started His ministry. Since Jesus never preached anything He didn’t practice (Acts 1:1 – DO and TEACH), I believe we can look at the Sermon on the Mount and rightfully say ‘This is what Jesus was like for those 30 years.’ Everything that Jesus preached is what He had practiced diligently and perfectly lived out for those 30 years before He preached it.

Jesus was gentle, even when people were harsh with Him. (Matt 5:3-5)

He hungered for righteousness (Matt 5:6). He must have read verses like Proverbs 3:32 ‘God is intimate with the upright’ and been driven by it, because He wanted intimacy with the Father more than anything and desperately didn’t want any break of fellowship.

He was merciful toward people (Matt 5:7). His family growing up wasn’t sinless like He was. But He had immense mercy toward them. He overlooked their sins toward Him, and not only that but appreciated the good that they tried to do even when it wasn’t perfect. He was full of mercy and patience toward people.

He had a pure heart (Matt 5:8), never with any ill motives, always seeking the eternal best for the other person.

He always sought for peace (Matt 5:9). There must have been fights among all of His brothers. He was one who preferred to be wronged for the sake of peace rather than to join in and fight and argue back when someone else was being unreasonable.

He rejoiced inwardly when people persecuted Him for doing God’s will (Matt 5:11). He didn’t laugh and smile over it, but it was an inward joy, where He praised God afterward for the honor of being able to be persecuted and suffer for the sake of His Father.

He always watched His mouth and didn’t insult people out of anger (Matt 5:22).

From a young age when sexual temptation started to tempt Him, He practiced controlling His eyes and starving them from indulging looking at pretty women (Matt 5:28). As the years went by He had such self-control that the temptation that plagues almost every young man didn’t have any pull on Him anymore.

He hated sin so much that He would’ve rather cut off a body part than sin with it (Matt 5:29).

He never sought revenge for Himself (Matt 5:38-39).

He was a generous man always going above and beyond for people with His time (Matt 5:40-41). He was a carpenter, maybe He had impatient or ungrateful customers. He went out of His way to do good for them, preferring rather to lose His own money and time for their sake, rather than have a very lucrative business.

There were people that hated Him for different reasons but He had a genuine concern for them anyways and prayed for them in secret (Matt 5:44), never telling anybody about His prayers.

He saw how much His Father loved the people of this world, and cherished that in His Father’s heart, and so this love filled His heart too (Matt 5:45-47).

He was concerned about making sure He was clean INWARDLY (which only God sees), not just OUTWARDLY where men see it (Matt 6:1).

He did His works in secret, He would give in the temple and help the poor when the opportunity came up, but He never made a big deal of it or talked about it afterward (Matt 6:3-4).

He prayed a lot inside of His room at home, where no one was there except for Him and God. He never bragged to His family or friends about how many hours He prayed. It was only between Him and His Father in Heaven (Matt 6:6).

He didn’t recite prayers from the Old Testament, but prayed with meaning whatever the burden of His heart was – which was mainly that God’s will would be done and that God would keep Him from sin (Matt 6:7-10).

He was a master at overlooking the faults of others and sins people committed against Him (Matt 6:14).

He fasted, but went out of His way to make sure people wouldn’t notice. When He fasted, He looked just the same as when He didn’t fast (Matt 6:16).

His desire was set on Heavenly things (treasures) that last forever. He didn’t think about or concern Himself with earthly gain which He saw as worthless since it’s temporary (Matt 6:19-20).

His attitude toward money was He didn’t worry about it (Matt 6:24-25). He knew His Father would just take care of Him (Matt 6:26), and didn’t have any desire to chase after it. Even when His carpentry business was slow, His joy and peace was exactly the same as when it was going well.

He judged Himself the hardest, and there may have been times when He felt had to rebuke someone. Maybe He had to deal with His brothers at home after His earthy Father Joseph died, since He was the oldest man of the house. He was careful to be merciful on them, but also He knew He had the right to do it since it was out of love and He had taken those sins seriously Himself first. He would never dare correct someone for a sin that He hadn’t taken seriously Himself first (Matt 7:1-2).

He sought God with all of His heart (Matt 7:7). You see this when He was 12 years old in the temple, but this was true for His whole life. Even when He was older the Bible says He often withdrew to the mountains to be alone with God. God was all that He loved and wanted and because of this, He loved everyone else perfectly as well.

His view of God wasn’t one of a hard, withdrawn Father, but a loving Father who was eager to give good things to His children, even more eager than the children were to receive them! (Mat 7:11)

He saw that primary of these good things that the Father gives is the Holy Spirit (Matt 7:11/Luke 11:13) – He knew that His Father was eager to pour out the Spirit on Him, and so He did... both to live a perfect life mastering every sin inward and outward, and then He prayed to be filled with the Spirit for ministry when it was time.

He spent so much of His life meditating on God’s word. He probably didn’t have scripture at home but He was at the temple learning all He could when He had a chance, and what He memorized and learned He meditated on and labored for and prayed so hard to make sure that He obeyed it perfectly, every word (Matt 7:24-26).

His whole life, He lived to do one thing – God’s will (Matt 7:24-26). He summed up His ambition near the end of His life when He said ‘My food is to do the will of the One who sent me’ (John 4:34). Jesus was the most single-minded man that ever lived.


# Chapter Ten
## Walking On Eggshells
*Feb 17, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=26)] 

There’s a saying in the English language called ‘walking on eggshells’. Another way it could be translated is ‘having to speak and act very carefully in order not to offend someone.’ You get the picture of a person having to walk very lightly on a bed of half-cut eggshells turned upside-down and if he steps too hard or makes one wrong move, everything will be broken!

We use this phrase when referring to interaction with people who are hard to get along with. Some wives have to walk on eggshells with sensitive husbands, some employees have to walk on eggshells with angry bosses, some children have to walk on eggshells with wrathful parents. No Christian should ever be a person of whom it is said ‘I have to walk on eggshells with him.’

If you are married, one test you can take to see if you are a person like this is to ask your spouse the question, “Do you ever at any time feel you have to walk on eggshells with me? Do you ever feel that you have to be so careful with your words and actions that if you do or say something wrong that a fight or argument will break out, or that we won’t be talking for some time?” The answer to this question can tell us if we are a person who gets offended easily.

A person who gets offended quickly cannot easily have fellowship with people, and almost certainly cannot be used to build God’s church. A person like this may find it hard to remain committed to a church for an extended period of time, and so may often be jumping from church to church, always looking back at how horrible the last church was (all that they felt was wrong with it) and how they were mistreated, or offended. At first they imagined it was the perfect church, but then after some time their hard hearts got offended (their sensitive egg shells were broken when someone walked on them too hard), and they decided it was time to move on.

If all of the disciples were like this, there would have been no New Covenant church! Jesus told them things like, “you of little faith” (Matthew 16:8), “how foolish you are” (Luke 24:25), and even “get behind me Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). Then there was one time Jesus said something so extreme that almost everybody got offended and left. He told them “you must eat my flesh and drink my blood” (John 6:53).

But the disciples weren’t ones whom Jesus had to ‘walk on eggshells’ with. He was able to tell them what they needed to hear all the time, and they humbled themselves and accepted it. That’s why there was hope for them, when everyone else left.

Their attitude was ‘Where shall we go? You have words of eternal life!’ (John 6:68)

The Lord desires disciples like that – who are so committed that He can speak anything to them through anybody, even if it’s a hard word, and instead of getting offended and storming off in anger to find another church, another marriage, another friend, they will endure and consider what words of life God is trying to speak to them through it. And it won’t harden their heart even one bit toward the one who spoke it.


# Chapter Eleven
## Asking God For Help All The Time
*Mar 26, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=27)] 

We understand that faith in God is marked by dependence upon Him and confidence in Him. Therefore, we can say that a dependent life is the only kind of life that is pleasing God, because God said “*And without faith it is impossible to please Him*” (Heb 11:6).

I believe one of the marks of someone who is dependent is by how much they ask for help.

When I think of some of the most godly people in the Bible, I see people who were utterly dependent on God, and cried out to Him for help often. I see Job who cried out to God who was his only refuge, David who wrote down many Psalms about crying out to God for his deliverance from enemies. Paul who asked God for deliverance from a thorn in his flesh until he got an answer (2 Corinthians 12:8). Daniel who cried out for help when men were trying to kill him for his faith (Dan 6:11). Asaph (Psalm 73) who was tormented by his own envy of the wicked people around him, had to find refuge in God’s house and ask for help for deliverance from his inward struggle. These are just some examples.

The most godly people in the Bible were dependent people, who did not think they could accomplish anything apart from God, but instead cried to God for help. Not one was such a ‘go-getter’ who imagined they could control things and gain victory for themselves apart from God’s help.

Of course, the most wonderful example of dependence on God is our Lord Himself who said, “I can do nothing on my own.” (John 5:30 NLT)

With an attitude like this, we can be sure that He cried out to God for help all the time. And this is exactly what the Bible says. Much of Psalm 69 is a prophecy about Jesus (“*my zeal for your house has consumed me*” – verse 9, “*for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink*” – verse 21). I believe verse 3 also talks about Jesus when it says “*I am exhausted from crying for help; my throat is parched*” (Psalm 69:3 NLT). Jesus cried out to God for help all the time, so much so that His throat dried out! He was one who followed Philippians 4:6 perfectly: “*Be anxious for nothing, **but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God***.”

He was never anxious for anything because He always asked God for help.

What did He ask God for help with? Primarily it was to keep Him from sin.

Hebrews 5:7 – “*In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety*.”

Jesus hated sin so much and knew that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), which is separation of fellowship with God, and so He cried to His Father all the time to keep Him from that.

We don’t need to always figure out the details of what we need to pray or how to pray. Sometimes we don’t even know what our current problem is and what to ask for, we may just feel a disconnect with God in our spirit. But the answer is wonderfully simple, just cry out to our loving Father with a simple prayer asking “help”, and the Holy Spirit will help us with the rest (Romans 8:26). He’s a loving Father who’s eager to lift us back up close to Him, to keep us from sin and separation from Him, and to comfort us in our time of need. We just need to go to Him and ask for help, not worrying about how many words, how few words, or how elegant of words we are coming to Him with.


# Chapter Twelve
## A Hostile Mind
*May 12, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=29)] 

Colossians 1:21**“**And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, *engaged* in evil deeds, 22 yet He has now reconciled you…”

Romans 8:7 “the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,”

A HOSTILE MIND

There’s something about my mind that I have to recognize is hostile toward God. And I tried to think about what that was and as far as I can understand I would define a hostile mind as a mind that tends to be consumed with thoughts about myself – selfish thoughts. Concerns about myself and not the things of God or His concerns.

I believe Colossians 3:2 is referring to a mind that is opposite of a hostile mind:

*‘Set your mind on things above, not on the things that are on earth’*

The way that I would translate it is: set my mind on things that God wants, that are God’s desires and God’s ambitions, and not on my own desires, ambitions and my own will – the things that I want.

My mind is always active, and has thousands and thousands of thoughts coming through every day all the time, constantly, and what’s the standard that God wants me to have on how I handle these thoughts?

I think the answer to that is in 2 Corinthians 10:5 where it says:

“*We are* destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and ***we are* taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ**”

EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE

That is a pretty high calling! To take *every* thought captive. I think of it like there’s an enemy encamped around a walled city, and the enemy is sending in their soldiers, two at a time, three at a time, one at a time, and every time a soldier gets close to the wall it tries to dig through it but the king of the city inside the wall says ‘go take that enemy soldier captive and throw them in jail’. And every enemy that comes, if you let one of them get by and give him enough time to successfully dig a hole then the rest of the army can easily get through and the whole city will be compromised!

Temptations are what I would equate to those soldiers that are coming at us all the time. Temptations aren’t sin in themselves, unless I don’t take them captive, and just go along with them and let them do whatever they want- ‘That’s not too bad, I’ll just let it through’ – that’s when destruction comes in and sin happens (James 1:15).

So what does that mean to take every thought captive?

WATCH AND PRAY

I was reminded of when the disciples were in Gethsemane and Jesus was there pouring out His heart right before He was taken and He gave a single command to the disciples (it was a temptation for them to follow it because they were tired – the constant temptation was to let the flesh take over and fall asleep and forget about what Jesus was about to go through). The only command He gave them was: watch and pray (Mat 26:41). So I think that’s a word directly for me. To be able to take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, that means I must watch and pray.


# Chapter Thirteen
## Surrender Is A Predetermination To Obey God
*Jun 8, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=31)] 

I have to make the decision to surrender my thought life to God. I have to say ‘Lord I don’t want to just let my mind wander wherever it wants, I don’t want my mind to be consumed with myself, I want it to be consumed with what you want and what you desire.’ Specifically with regard to sin, I don’t want it to just run rampant and do whatever it wants, but I want to predetermine beforehand that my mind will not allow it in.

I believe that’s what surrender is. **I believe surrender is making a determination beforehand to give up my will**. *Overcoming* is in the moment of temptation denying myself, but *surrender* is denying myself before something has ever happened – giving myself up.

The other day I was on the road and I was driving behind a car that had an odd device spinning around on the top, and I read on the back of it something like ‘Google driverless car’. There are these cars that can drive themselves, there’s someone in the car but they aren’t driving the car. The car is driven by very complex software and mechanical devices. The person inside is just taking notes, and making sure the car doesn’t malfunction or do anything dangerous or foolish.

I remember hearing stories about how some people try to mess with the car just to see what happens – driving in front of it and slamming on their brakes or cutting it off. But the wonderful thing about this car is that it has been pre-programmed beforehand to always make the safest and wisest choice. It has been pre-programmed never to get revenge for itself, it doesn’t tailgate others when they cut it off or honk the horn out of anger, it doesn’t get anxious and drive dangerously to get somewhere on time. Because the computer programmers put instructions into the software beforehand, always make what’s the safest and wisest decision.

And I see myself as needing to do that when I surrender things in my life. Say “Lord I’m making the determination right now by your grace and the power of your Spirit, I’ll be able to overcome temptation by making the decision right now that when the temptation comes up I’m not going to give into it.” So that’s why they say these driverless cars are much safer than human drivers. Because humans are corrupted with sin!

I see that when God’s filling us with His Spirit and we surrender ourselves to what He wants then we can overcome, and give up our will in that moment when we’ve made a determination beforehand. It’s much easier than if we’d have just not thought about it at all, and then the temptation comes in a moment and now I have to think about and decide what the right course of action is. But if I’d have made the decision 3 months earlier not to sin in this area (honk my horn out of revenge, yell at another person, for example), then it’s much easier to not sin in that moment.

Praise God that by His Spirit we can have authority over our mind and our thought life.


# Chapter Fourteen
## The Measure Of Love
*Jul 23, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=34)] 

Can love be measured? We can’t put a number on it, but I believe the measure of love is how much a person is willing to give up for someone else.

For example, John 3:16 shows the measure of God’s love for the world: *“For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should have everlasting life.”*

How big was God’s love? God SO loved the world that He gave His only Son. The measure of God’s love for us is that He *sacrificed* what was of the highest value to Him.

The measure of love is shown by its willingness to sacrifice for someone else.

John 15:13 *“Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends”*

God loves us and has shown us this by His immense sacrifice, and He desires us to love Him like that too. How much does He want us to love Him? He wants us to love Him just as if He was the only thing in life that mattered:

Luke 14:26*“If anyone comes to Me, and does not**hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.*

I have been blessed to see this illustrated in different ways in the Bible, such as the Psalms:

Psalm 45:10-11 *“Listen, O daughter, give attention and incline your ear:*
*Forget your people and your father’s house; Then the King will desire your beauty.
 Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him.”*

I suppose there is nothing more precious on this earth to a person than their family. But even compared to this, God says ‘forget your people and your father’s house.’

He is the King of Kings and everyone in the kingdom will worship Him alone and see Him as so precious that nothing else matters compared to Him:

Zechariah 14:9 *“And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.”*

Paul was an example of a man who had an attitude like this. See what he wrote to the Corinthians:

1 Corinthians 2:2 *“For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.”*

I’m sure I’m not alone in saying I am still fighting to try to be single-minded – with my eyes set on God alone (to know the Father and the Son – John 17:3). But at least I can (like Paul) *determine*myself to be like that! We may not be there yet, but each of us can determine with our whole hearts that we will love God with all of our heart, soul and mind (Matt 22:37).

Psalm 27:4 “*One thing I have asked from the**Lord**, that I shall seek: That I may**dwell in the house of the**Lord**all the days of my life, To behold**the**beauty of the**Lord**, And to meditate in His temple.”*

We can see how much we love God by taking an honest look at where His priorities fall in our lives. What are we willing to lay on the altar for His sake? It’s easy to read the Bible, listen to sermons, pray for our loved ones, and try to do good when it’s convenient. But the real test is when we have to lay something down (our own will) for God when it’s a sacrifice.

1 John 5:3 *“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome”*

I want to be a Christian who loves God like that – with all my heart – because He gave up everything for me, and because compared to everything and everyone else, He is the only One Who truly matters.

## The Way Into God'S Home
*Aug 28, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=37)] 

GOD’S HOME

God has a home with many rooms in it, and Jesus prepared a place for us there (John 14:2)! One day we will enter that home in person, but we don’t have to wait do dwell in the same house with Him. He promised that He will come live with us and make His home with us here on earth, if we fulfill one condition: if we do His will.

THE CONDITION

Jesus said He and the Father will come and live with us – if we obey His commandments (John 14:23).

Jesus said we can be His family – if we do the will of His Father in Heaven (Matthew 12:48-50).

Jesus said we can be His friends – if we do what He commands us (John 15:14).

Jesus said we can be His disciples – if we deny our will to follow Him and do His will (Matthew 16:24).

Jesus even said that the reason our Heavenly Father was always with Him was because He always did His will:

John 8:29 "And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him”

The Bible seems pretty clear, if we want to be close to The Lord – living with Him, in fellowship with Him, having Him as our family, having Him as our best friend, *there’s only one single path* – to do His will and live to please God.

SMALL GATE AND NARROW PATH

I believe this is the narrow path Jesus talked about that only a few find (Matthew 7:13-14). But the rare few who are willing to surrender themselves to whatever God wants for their life – in situations both big and small, they have found the rare and narrow path that leads into God’s home.

Matthew 7:14 *For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.*

Jesus said that not only is the “gate” small (the entry into this life with Jesus when we first come to Him) but also that the “way” is narrow (the continuation of the life). We come to Jesus not expecting to give up everything in the beginning, only to take it back again later as we want it, but it’s a complete surrender of all intention to follow my will again in the future.

Just like how God commanded Lot and his wife not to look back at the wicked city, God’s home is for people who have no intention of ever living for themselves again, for their own pleasures – but of leaving it totally behind. I believe this is why Jesus started His ministry with the word “Repent” (Matt 4:17). His message was for those who were willing to turn away from their will, and turn to and follow God’s will from there on out. Anyone who is not willing to accept the message of “repent” can’t accept any of the things which Jesus would teach after that. It is a small gate and narrow way that leads to life with God.

*“The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried*.” GK Chesterton

MOTIVE

Jesus said that He always did what pleases His Father, and that’s why God was always with Him (John 8:29). Jesus pleased His Father not only by the actions that He took and things which He did but it was even more so about the motive with which He did them.

I don’t want to labor to do God’s will simply for the sake of ‘not sinning’, but I want to live my life laboring to do God’s will with the right motivation driving me. If I don’t have the right motivation, all of it will be useless, like ‘casting pearls before swine’.

I saw in the example of the Pharisees that a person can be deceived into thinking they are living for God’s will, but all the while they are still just living for themselves. I don’t want to fall for that deception! I believe the way to distinguish is to ask God if I really have the right *motive*. The Pharisees were convinced they’d surrendered everything to do God’s will and obey His commands (the law), but in essence they were basically still just living to please themselves (Matthew 23:5 “they do all their deeds to be noticed by men”). Their *motive* made all of their pursuits to follow God’s law useless. This is why they missed the narrow way, even though they deceived everyone (including themselves) into thinking they were on it.

As far as I can tell, I believe God wants me to have as my greatest motivation to do His will these two reasons: 1. To please Him because I love Him, 2. And to have fellowship with Him. I see in the Bible that Paul had these same motives: 1. he lived to please God (2 Cor 5:9 “Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him”), and 2. he lived to have fellowship with Him (Php 3:8 “I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ”).

If we are single minded like Jesus, daily living to do God’s will with the right motives, we can find ourselves living life at home with our Father in Heaven and our Lord Jesus, no matter where we go or what is happening in our life. God will be with us communicating intimately with us, comforting us, giving us rest and joy, and taking care of His house where we are living with Him.


# Chapter Sixteen
## Willingness To Be Interrupted
*Sep 19, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=38)] 

I’ve noticed in my flesh a very simple indicator of selfishness:

An annoyance in myself when being interrupted by people.

For example: I’m at work in the middle of working on an important project and I suddenly get a phone call from someone who frequently needs my assistance. Or I’m walking through the hall about to leave work after a long day and someone pulls me aside to ask a long-winded question or have a full conversation. Or I’m at home in the middle of something that seems important and my children suddenly become hungry and start asking for me to get them some food. These are interruptions that tempt me to give in to selfishness.

Outwardly the temptation is to snap back with some excuse (which at least sounds genuine) why I do not have time for that person. Inwardly it is to say to myself things like, “I have other things I have to do, can’t I just get one minute alone, I’m in the middle of something important.”

When I saw in myself an unwillingness to be interrupted (that is, an unwillingness to be generous with my time), I felt the Lord speak a simple, gentle word to me: “If you really want to be like Jesus, you have work on that.” Then I thought about how generous Jesus was with His time and how willing He was to be interrupted by people because He loved them so much, and was fully freed from selfishness. For example:

Matthew 14:13 *“Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself; and when the people heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the cities. 14 When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.”*

At one of the rare moments when it seemed that Jesus really needed a moment to Himself (to mourn John’s death), the people continued to follow Him and would not leave Him alone. He did not try to evade them or run away faster than them (He could have even called a legion of Angels to carry Him away to be alone!) Instead, He had ‘compassion’ on them and healed their sick – plainly and simply, He put others before Himself. He was grieving immensely to lose one of the people He loved the most, and instead of demanding some time for Himself to mourn, He gave Himself over to serve others. Now *that* is an unselfish man!

It's not that our Lord was a push-over who always let others determine what He was doing. There were times when He didn't jump right away for the needs of others because it wasn't God's will for Him. For example in John 11 when Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus that Lazarus was very sick. Jesus didn't go to him right away (because He was listening to the Spirit's guidance), and Lazarus died. But eventually He did go and then He raised Lazarus from the dead, bringing many people to believe in Him (John 11:45). It's not about always doing what other people want, but about having the *willingness* to put their needs above our own (when God calls us to).

My goal and my prayer is to be like Jesus how He was so patient, and generous with His time. Never eager to set others aside so He could “get back to His business”, but to genuinely concern Himself with their issues too. I believe this is what it means to bear one another’s burdens:

Galatians 6:2 *“Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ”*


# Chapter Seventeen
## Difficult People
*Nov 8, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=41)] 

Jesus had His share of difficult people to interact with in His life. Some scorned Him, some persecuted Him, some scoffed at Him and others just neglected or ignored Him. He had people yelling at Him, spitting on Him, arguing with Him, trying to trap Him, and trying to kill Him.

Every one of us will have difficult people to interact with throughout our lives. They may seem ungodly, mean, cruel, annoying, and evil. Here are a few principles the Bible has to say about difficult people that have helped me:

*John 8:7 "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"*

**The most important thing I’ve learned about difficult people is that I’m one of them!**

Other people may be sinful, difficult and selfish toward me... but I have exactly the same flesh as them and I'm just as guilty. I’ve experienced that the more clearly I see how difficult, selfish, and sinful I myself have been toward my Perfect Father in Heaven, the easier it is to have mercy and patience toward other people who sin against me. A Pharisee is one who looks down on others in frustration, but a Christian is one who is mostly frustrated and fed up with themselves and their own sin (Luke 18:9-13). The kingdom of God belongs not to people who are fed up with difficult co-workers, evil government, selfish family, bad churches, or lukewarm Christians. It belongs to people who are fed up with themselves! These are the “poor” in spirit who come to the Lord like poor beggars and say “Lord, I’m the one who needs help, I’m just a poor sinful beggar, forgive me and help me!”

*“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.”* (Matthew 5:3)

Another important principle I see the Bible teaching me is to love difficult people, no matter how they treat me in return:

*Matthew 5:44 "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."*

*Romans 2:2 "The kindness of God leads you to repentance."*

I once heard a story: Early one morning the wind challenged the sun to a competition. There was a man walking along the road with his coat on and the wind told the sun 'I think I can get that man to remove his coat before you can.' The sun agreed to play the game. The wind said he'd go first. The wind blew and blew as hard as it could, and the harder he blew, the tighter the man held his coat. Then the sun said, 'ok now let me try.' So the sun raised himself up in the sky and shined just a little bit, and in a short amount of time, the man gently removed his coat. The moral of the story is that it's better to warm a person with love, rather than to try to blow them around and control them with anger and force.

Is our Father in Heaven like the wind or the sun? The Bible says that it's God's love that has caused us to love Him (1 John 4:19), and His kindness that has caused us to repent (Romans 2:2). I believe we'll see that principle in our life as well when dealing with others. Loving others diligently and selflessly is the way to bring unity and agreement into relationships rather than fighting with them and trying to force them to agree with us or treat us right.

Many times love won’t change an enemy’s heart toward us right away (and maybe never), but that’s ok. If we continue to love our enemies and the unrepentant people who sin against us we can have the privilege of being like our Father in Heaven, because that’s how He is – He is immensely patient and loving even toward evil people who still consider Him their enemy:

*Matthew 5:44-45 “But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous”*

A son is someone who is just like his Dad. Jesus said to love our enemies, and in that way we can be sons of our Father who is in Heaven.

*Proverbs 15:1 "A gentle answer turns away wrath."*

The tongue is a powerful thing. *“The tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!”* (James 3:5).

By it wars are started and ended. Even better, wars are prevented! The Bible says that instead of answering anger for anger, wrath with wrath, it’s best to give gentle words and gentle answers in return to a wrathful person. This is the best way to peace. God does not desire fighters (returning evil words for evil words), but peacemakers (Matt 5:9). We can be a peacemaker by responding to the wrath of others with gentle words.

Proverbs 17:13-14 *“He who returns evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house. The beginning of strife is like letting out water, So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.”*

## What Real Love Looks Like
*Dec 11, 2015*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=43)] 

![](images/43.jpg)

As a parent, one thing I’ve come to learn is that true love for someone does not mean you give them whatever they want. For example, my children would like to eat donuts every night for dinner. In this situation, my love for them is the very reason that I deny them what they want. When I deny them, they may be tempted to think I don’t love them. But real love desires the person’s long-term good, over giving them what they want all the time.

It’s very helpful to me to remember that God loves me with such a perfect love, that He will deny many of my earthly desires. To someone who doesn’t know God, this may look like God doesn’t care for or love them. But whoever knows God as their loving Father, they will no doubt be thankful for the many prayers and desires He *didn’t answer,* knowing that when they come into eternity they will look back and say “I’m glad He did things exactly the way He did.”

So if real love for my children doesn’t look like ‘giving them whatever they want’, what does it look like? The Bible – our foundation of truth tells us what real love is and what it looks like. I’d like to list out many practical examples of love the Lord has burdened my heart with, that illustrate the principles of real love as defined by the Bible. This isn’t meant to be a complete exhaustive list, but a list of examples God has put on my heart as practical goals I can have as I try love others, and God better.

*CHILDREN*

**Real love toward my children should look like:**

• Asking God for wisdom to raise them (James 1:5)

• Praying for them consistently

• Taking their sin and disobedience very seriously, and not brushing it off

• Carefully disciplining them and rebuking them when it will build them up, not too severely and not too lightly, and never out of anger (Prov 3:11-12, Col 3:21, Heb 12:5-8)

• Teaching them that God loves them and is always with them, so they never have to be scared, and they can talk to Him any time (Heb 13:6)

• Teaching them the Bible, giving them foundational godly wisdom for life and godliness (Prov 4:5)

• Being patient with them (Eph 4:2)

• Not ignoring them

• Spending quality time with them

• Encouraging them (1 Thess 5:11)

• • Not losing my temper and snapping in anger at them (responding verbally or physically in a harsh way that is driven not by desire for their good but anger)

• Playing with them and laughing with them

*SPOUSE*

**Real love toward my wife should look like:**

• Praying for and encouraging her (Heb 3:13)

• Plain and simple kindness (Eph 4:32)

• Considering what burdens she’s had throughout the day when I’ve been away at work

• Holding my tongue and keeping quiet when I am tempted to be angry or frustrated (James 1:19)

• Working hard at my job to provide for her what she needs (food, shelter, etc) without getting in to debt and making our family a slave to others outside our home (1 Tim 5:8)

• Being faithful to her - not committing adultery in the heart by looking lustfully at another woman (Matt 5:28)

• Being a servant, sacrificing time and energy to make things easier for her (John 13:12-14)

• Helping with household chores

• Not leaving messes around the house

• Sharing little words that God has spoken to me - ‘salting the conversation’ (Col 4:6) with the things of God, and ‘washing her in the Word’ (Ephesians 5:26)

• Expressing appreciation for her

• Laboring to present her as a spotless bride to Jesus (Ephesians 5:27)

• Rooting for her to grow in the Lord

• Playfully joking with her to make her smile, and to let her know that I enjoy her (Prov 5:18-19)

*THE CHURCH*

**Real love toward my church should look like:**

• Being quick and eager to forgive others (Eph 4:32, Prov 19:11, Luke 17:3)

• Encouraging them - letting them know how special to God they are and loved, and how necessary to the church body they are (Heb 3:13)

• Encouraging them to seek for an intimate life with the Lord, desiring that they would be enraptured with Him and not anything else in this life (2 Cor 11:2-3)

• Challenging them to become Christ-like (Heb 6)

• Praying for them in secret (Php 2:3-4, Matt 6:6)

• Not gossiping or speaking negatively about others (Psalm 41:7)

• Doing what I can to help them if I become aware of some need they have (James 2:15-16)

• Thinking of them throughout the week and bearing burdens of others, praying with real meaning for them and pouring my heart out to God (Gal 6:2, Matt 6:7)

• Never comparing myself with anybody in the church (2 Cor 10:12)

• Being real, not a fake hypocrite – “Let love be without hypocrisy” - being open about my own weaknesses and not trying to hide them so people think I’m godly (Rom 12:9), and thereby discouraging them making them think they are ungodly because they still have struggles

• Getting ‘under’ people by serving them and doing things quietly in the background, instead of trying to climb my way above everyone by seeking honor (Php 2:5-8)

• Weeping with those who are going through a hard time, not saying “I’m glad it’s not me” (Rom 12:15)

• Not being envious, but rejoicing with them when something good happens for them, cheering for them

• Exhorting them always to keep pressing into Jesus – to be persistent and consistent, to keep going even when things are tough (Matt 24:13)

• Gently rebuking them when necessary, so they can become aware and repent of their sin (Gal 6:1)

*GOD*

**Real love toward the Lord should look like:**

• Seeking Him alone and not His gifts (Psalm 73:25)

• Obedience, both inwardly and outwardly – “For this is love the love of God: that we keep His commandments” (1 John 5:3)

• Presenting my body as a living sacrifice to Him, and my body parts as His instruments of righteousness (Rom 12:1, Rom 6:13)

• Considering everything else on this earth besides Him as worthless, and living like that (not chasing after money, comfort, success or the pleasure of this world, but only chasing after Christ) – (Php 3:8)

• Laboring to build up His church (not in numbers but in Christ-likeness) “Do you love me? Tend my lambs” (John 21:15-17)

• Seeking for gifts that can build up the church in Christ, and eagerly desiring those gifts not to feel good about myself or significant, but desiring them for the sake of others (1 Cor 14:1-12)

• Being eager to spend time with Him and having a desire to always be in His presence, regardless of wherever I am or whatever I’m doing (1 John 1:7)

• Leaving anything He asks me to give up (even if not sinful) because I always want to be close to Him(Psalm 73:25, 28)

• Going to Him when I am struggling with some issue, and not trying to solve my problems myself without Him (1 Peter 5:6-7)

• Hating sin because it grieves Him (Eph 4:30). Not wanting to hurt the One I love the most

• Not complaining when something goes wrong or doesn’t turn out as I’d have hoped, but surrendering myself to it as God’s will, and praising Him in spite of the outcome (2 Cor 12:8-9)

• Being faithful to work hard at doing the mundane day to day tasks, because I’m doing it for Him (1 Cor 10:31, 1 Thess 4:11)

• Seeking eternal life – which is to know Him intimately (John 17:3)

• Cleansing myself because I want to be like Him (1 John 3:2-3) - (by cleansing, not just outwardly but cleansing all the evil that's inside – things like anger, selfishness, greed, loving money and material things, a gossiping tongue, laziness, lukewarmness toward seeking God)

Up to this point I’ve only tried to illustrate what I believe real human love looks and doesn’t look like. But I’ve also been blessed to meditate on and see in God’s Word what *His* perfect love for me does and doesn’t look like.

**God’s love for me doesn’t look like:**

• Answering every prayer and giving me whatever I ask, no matter the consequences (2 Cor 12:8-9)

• Withholding all sickness, physical issues, job or family problems

• Withholding every temptation from me (1 Cor 10:13)

• Making me very wealthy (Matt 19:23)

• Giving me only easy relationships (at work, in my family, in the church, etc)

**God’s love for me looks like:**

• Giving me many precious promises in His Word so I can partake of His nature (2 Peter 1:4)

• Justifying me through Christ and now seeing me as righteous, just as if I’ve never sinned (2 Cor 5:21)

• Filling me with His Spirit so I can live in righteousness, peace and joy in the Spirit (Romans 14:17)

• Always being with me (Heb 13:5)

• Not just changing my location forever (from Earth to Heaven), but changing what I am forever (2 Cor 5:17)

• Putting boundaries around me that will guide me to seek for Him (Acts 17:26-27)

• Willingness to subject me to hardship for my eternal good (Romans 8:28)

• Willingness to discipline me (Hebrews 12:6)

• Always providing my needs, both physical and spiritual (Luke 12:29-32)

• Always thinking of my eternal good over the temporary earthly gain I could have (Mark 8:36)

• A fervent desire and joy to fellowship with me and be close to me (Zeph 3:17)

• A fervent desire to see me grow in the image of Christ, and working all of my circumstances to achieve this goal (Rom 8:28-29)

**And the most special illustration to me of what God’s love for me looks like is:**

Not holding back what was most precious to Him - sending His Son to earth to become a man forever, and as a man to die for me so I can have an intimate relationship with Him, knowing Him as my loving Father: ***John 3:16, John 17:3***

*For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life – And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent*

***Luke 15:24***

*"For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate."*


# Chapter Nineteen
## Satan'S Scheme To Cause Division
*Jan 22, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=48)] 

SATAN’S MAJOR SCHEME

The Bible says that Satan has schemes that he tries to use against believers:

2 Corinthians 2:11 *“so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes”*

I’ve learned it helps me to look at context of a verse (what’s before and what’s after it), to get the full meaning of what the Bible says. If you look at the context of this passage (the verse/s before it), Paul is talking to the Corinthians specifically about one of Satan’s major schemes:

2 Corinthians 2:10 *“But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ”*

UNFORGIVENESS

The major scheme of Satan that Paul was warning the Corinthians against was **unforgiveness**. If you put verse 10 and 11 together then we can make this conclusion: if the Corinthians did not forgive each other, then Satan would be able to take advantage of them. His goal was to bring unforgiveness into the church and once that happened, he figured he could have a nice opportunity to take advantage of them and attempt to divide and tear apart the church of Corinth.

DIVISION

Satan is always using schemes to try to tear apart churches and families. Divisions in the church, divorces, parents forsaking children, children not talking to parents, family members hating each other, even abusing each other – Satan surely must have been quietly working his schemes in the background to cause these things – whispering lies to people to sow roots of unforgiveness, bitterness, judgment and hatred into the hearts of as many people as he could.

FEAR THE EVIL INSIDE, NOT THE EVIL OUTSIDE

There are some churches and Christians in these last days that are being persecuted around the world – threatened, thrown in jail, even killed. But I don’t believe this is Satan’s first choice. Those churches, if faithful are actually giving glory to God and laying up treasure in Heaven! Satan surely hates when churches are faithful in the midst of persecution. He is much happier with the multitudes of other churches which instead of being torn apart from the outside, are tearing themselves apart from the inside with things like unforgiveness, judgment, bitterness, strife and jealousy toward each other. He must be much happier to see a church fall into that than fall into persecution!

Jesus said, "*there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man*" (Mark 7:15). Here, Jesus was teaching us that we are defiled only by that which is inside us (that is, our sins). So no amount of outside pressure can force us to sin. Similarly, it is not what happens outside of a church or a family that affects its purity, but what happens inside. God’s name is profaned not when His people are persecuted or surrounded by evil, but when His people are the source of the evil itself.

We are in the last days, and are promised persecution (2 Tim 3:12). But I see that my concern needs to be keeping from falling into evil rather than keeping myself from being persecuted by evil.

CONCLUSION

The next time I feel little whispers in my head of things like “look what this person did, that's terrible", “look how ignorant this person is to not see your point of view”, etc. I will recognize that this is Satan using one of his main schemes to try to use me to tear my family or my church apart from the inside out. I can reject it as a lie and ask God to bind Satan’s hands so he cannot accomplish his work of division. If I recognize Satan attacking in the context of my church, I can unite in prayer with other brothers and sisters to bind Satan’s hands, and if in the context of my family, I can unite in prayer with my wife to bind Satan’s hands in my home (Matthew 18:18-20). I can pour out my heart to God asking Him to preserve all unity in my family and in my church.

When we recognize Satan trying to work, we must resist him - by watching, praying and asking God to deal with him and also to strengthen us. If we do this, not only will he surely flee (James 4:7), but we can also turn his works around on him so that he can’t accomplish anything, and instead of weakening our family or church, it will actually be stronger than before!

**“When Satan comes knocking, send Jesus to answer the door.”**

## Love Makes A Servant
*Mar 24, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=52)] 

I’ve heard that the purest human love in the world is the love a mother has for her child. A mother denies herself constantly day and night, doing many lowly tasks for her child because of love. If the child has a dirty diaper, she never says ‘that’s not my gift’. She changes the diaper because it’s a *need* of the child whom she loves. She changes thousands of diapers because of love. She wakes up all early hours of the morning to comfort and feed her baby because of love.

A mother’s eyes are continually scanning and watching to meet every one of her child’s needs, and she’s quick to act if the baby cries. This is all because of love.

A mother doesn’t receive anything in return. That child never shows any appreciation, except to cry and scream for more milk, more diaper changes, more cuddling. What pure love a mother has to continue to serve this child!

In every area of life I believe we can see this principle: **pure love makes a servant**. Love produces a servant, and a servant is one who is eager to constantly watch for the needs of others, and willing to deny his or herself (without expecting anything in return) for the sake of those needs.

Matthew 25:40 “*‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.”*

In Matthew 25:40 Jesus said that doing little deeds such as visiting the sick or giving a drink to someone, it's just like we are doing it for Jesus Himself. A person who is only interested in doing great and extravagant things is no servant of Jesus.

Image a man in a local church who wants to be helpful, and so he asks the elders if he can help serve. He is told that the church needs help with cleaning after the meetings. He responds “That’s not my gift.” In other words – he wants to do something greater, something bigger than scrubbing toilets and vacuuming floors. “Only then can I really make a difference in the church. I want to do *great* things for the church.” Can we say that a man like this has love for his church? I don’t believe we can say he has much love for the church or that his love for the church is pure, because he is not like a mother – he doesn’t care about the *lowly* *needs*he can help with, he cares primarily about how great and extravagant his task will be. He figures, if he does significant things then that makes him significant. But Jesus said that’s not true at all:

*“**The greatest among you must be a servant”* – Matt 23:11

I remember being humbled by the example I saw one time of a man in a very high position who was at home cleaning up the house and picking up some garbage off of the ground while his family was relaxing on the couch. I thought “Wow, this man doesn’t care about his position, he just sees a need and takes care of it.” And even to this day when I think back it makes me want to be like that!

So if I want to be like that, the question is – what are the *needs*the Lord wants me to be watchful for? What the Lord needs from me comes first, and the needs of others come second. My needs come last. I remember the acronym for this as J.O.Y. - Jesus, Others, Yourself. If I prioritize the needs I see in that order - of Jesus first, others second, and myself last – I believe this is the path to being a **joy**ful servant of the Lord.

Here are some examples: the Lord *needs* me to deny myself and be obedient in this temptation, the Lord *needs* me to be careful with my words in this conversation, the church *needs* to have chairs setup before the meeting, this brother *needs* an encouraging word, my wife *needs* help cleaning the living room, my coworker *needs* help getting his project out on time. The *needs* are daily and frequent, and they require a self-denial on my part for the sake of others, and a “considering others as more important than myself” (Php 2:3). And if I am filled with God’s love in my heart I will be constantly scanning and watching, how can I meet the needs of the Lord, and the needs of others that God wants me to meet.

Like Jesus who washed His disciple’s feet when they were dirty and needed cleaning (John 13), may God fill our hearts with the same love that will make us into servants of love like our Lord Jesus. Servants who will not live primarily for ourselves, but continually have this “scanning” in our hearts – “Lord, what are the needs right now you want me to be aware of, and what shall I do about them?”

## Faith And Patience Bring Rest
*Apr 29, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=55)] 

Hebrews 6:12 “so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through **faith and patience** inherit the promises.”

I've seen in my life that faith and patience are tied together. If I can't be patient to wait on the Lord, my faith will start to shake. In 2 Peter chapter 3 it seems some of the believers Peter was writing to were getting impatient while waiting for the Lord to come back. Maybe their faith was being shaken, maybe doubts were starting to come in about His return. Peter's answer to them was that the delay was not because He's a *slow*God, but it's because He's a *patient*God - patiently working in secret for different reasons (2 Peter 3:9). He's much more interested in a *quality*result than a *quick* result.

2 Peter 3:9 *"The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you..."*

This is why the full answer to some of my prayers for His promises and working out of some circumstances/struggles in my life is sometimes slower than I expect - because He's a *patient*God who is much more interested in *quality* than *speed*.

If I remember how much God loves me and that He is working in secret on my behalf, I can have rest even in the midst of a difficult waiting period.

Imagine two very hungry children sitting in the backseat of a car during a long car ride home. They are almost home but are getting very anxious because of their hunger pains. One child is 5 years old and the other child is 1 year old. Their father who is driving the car tells them “We're almost home, just a little bit longer and then we can give you some food.” Which child will be able to stop screaming? The older mature child can stop screaming because he can comprehend the word ‘wait a little bit, your food is coming.’ He can comprehend that his father knows he is hungry, and that he has every intention of feeding him soon. “You are hungry. I know and I care. But you have to wait until we get home and then I can give you food.” This can calm that 5 year old child who now understands it’s just a little longer to endure the hunger, then he can eat. There is now hope in him. But a 1 year old has no concept of ‘wait’ and as far as this baby knows, he or she may never eat again! So it has no rest. It keeps screaming because of its hunger pains and lack of understanding of the parent’s love and care which doesn’t allow it to cling to hope, and so there is no rest in its current hunger pain.

A mature believer will be like that older child – able to patiently wait because they are acknowledging the Father is loving and has every good intention for them (that’s faith). Faith and patience go together. And **when both faith and patience are there, there can be a rest from screaming and panic even in the midst of current pain that's lasting for some time**.

God has countless wonderful things in His will for us (Jeremiah 29:11). He wants us to be free from slavery to our sins, to rejoice always in the Lord, to be able to be people who pray without ceasing, to have a peace that surpasses understanding. He wants to fill us with His Spirit, to use us to build His church, to have a heavenly home, a good marriage, godly children. There are so many precious things we can gain if we are obedient and have faith in Him... but not if we give up too early, not if we get discouraged too early. We must also be “Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying” (Romans 12:12 - NLT). God doesn’t grant all these things fully instantly, but over time to the patient humble ones who keep on pressing on regardless of what circumstances look like, clinging to hope in the Lord with faith and patience. Wherever a persisting struggle is for one of His children, the Lord is always saying “I care, and I’m working… just be patient a little while longer as I work.”

1 Peter 5:10 *After you have suffered **for a little while**, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.*

This wait of ours does not have to be one full of gritting our teeth and sitting idle. Going back to Hebrews 6:12, see how it starts out: “**so that you will not be sluggish**, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” This wait of ours is a joyful, hopeful, active wait. Just like how Noah was occupied doing God's will by building the ark while waiting patiently for what God said would come, we can be active to continue the work He has called us to do in the meantime. Life doesn't stop because we are waiting on God in patience. It's in these times that our faith is proved and grown more than it ever would have been had we seen Him finish His work immediately.

## The Way Out Of Spiritual Paralysis
*May 26, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=56)] 

John 5:6 *When Jesus saw him lying**there**, and knew that he had already been a long time**in that condition**, He \*said to him,**“Do you wish to get well?”**7 The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when**the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”**8 Jesus \*said to him,**“Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.”**9 Immediately the man became well, and picked up his pallet and**began**to walk.*

38 YEARS PARALYZED

Jesus met this man who had been paralyzed for 38 years, who was constantly looking for healing. His hope for deliverance was in the ‘miracle pool’ of Bethesda and he thought “if I can just get in there when the water is stirred up, all my problems will be over.” As far as I can tell this man saw three reasons why he couldn’t be healed: 1. The miracle pool needed to be stirred up (circumstances needed to fall into place first) 2. No other person would help him, and 3. when he tried to help himself to get into the pool, other selfish people got in the way and took his spot.

ELIMINATING THE SPIRIT OF BLAME

When we’re in a point where we are struggling it’s very tempting to blame either our circumstances, or other people for our state. We may feel that we are struggling spiritually and are in a horribly unhappy state of life because some situation, or some person (or people) have caused us so many problems and grief. “Life is too hard, there are too many trials, my parents never showed me real love, my spouse won’t seek the Lord with me, this person tempts me to anger constantly, I can’t catch a break,” etc.

Like the paralyzed man in John 5, a person who consistently blames outward circumstances or other people for their inner struggle will be paralyzed spiritually and never find the victorious walk with the Lord that God intends for them.

TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION

I believe a great encouragement for every person who struggles with this, regardless of circumstances in their lives is:

*Behold, now is “the acceptable time,” behold, now is “the day of salvation”* (2 Corinthians 6:2)

Salvation is available *today*. He can be our salvation from whatever is pressing us down and making us paralyzed. It doesn’t matter what the circumstances, what other people are doing to us – we can choose to set aside all that others are saying and doing and look to Him alone for salvation today. Maybe OUTWARDLY none of our physical circumstances will change for a while, our enemies will still be persecuting us, our physical conditions may still remain for a while. But INWARDLY in our spirits we can spring up with joy, pick up our mat and walk with Him in victory. Then it won’t matter whatever our situations are on the outside, because inwardly we are filled with a fountain of peace and joy which is the presence of the Lord with us.

ALL WE NEED IS HIM

We don’t need a ‘miracle pool’ if we have Jesus. Previously, our ‘miracle pool’ may have been the thought that we need less trials, more money, more luck, more friends, and the people in our life need to be more godly and to treat us better. But like the paralyzed man, the answer was none of these things. It was simply to look to Jesus who is with us, to listen to what He said to him, to believe it, and to do it.

To get up from our spiritual paralysis and be able to stand up against sin and discouragement, and to walk with the Lord in victory, we don’t need situations or other people to change. All we need is HIM ALONE. To look to Him, and listen to Him, to obey and follow Him.

“Trust and obey, for there’s no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.”

CONCLUSION

What a wonderful encouragement from our Lord. We don't need a 'miracle pool', just Him and His Word. This means that ANYBODY (no matter how dire their lives look) can have hope. Our God is truly a God of hope to anybody who believes (Romans 15:13). Praise the Lord!

Romans 15:13 *Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.*


# Chapter Twenty Three
## Spirituality And Worship
*Oct 5, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=60)] 

God made man very different from the animals. First of all He made us in His image (Gen 1:26-27), He breathed His own breath into us, giving us life (Gen 2:7), and He gave us each something that no animal has - a spirit (1 Cor 2:11). Not even the smartest animals on earth, (no matter how much DNA is claimed they have in common with humans) ever prayed to or worshiped anything. But even the most uncivilized and remote people on earth all had some type of religion. This is because God made man like this from the beginning, to be spiritual – to know there’s a God, and to seek Him.

Gen 4:26b *“**Thenmenbeganto callupon the name of theLord.”*

But most people throughout history have tried to become ‘spiritual’ and in touch with God (or what they believe to be God) through something which can never reach Him: *externals*. It’s like building the tower of Babel – trying to get to God by the works of our hands.

Men have created traditions, idols, material representations of every kind, done multitudes of external good works, all to try to meet the call of their spirit – the call to seek and worship God.

Today even many Christian churches have gone down this same path, sincerely believing that the worship of God is found in externals such as: praise music, works to reach the lost, stirring sermons, Bible knowledge, helping the poor, refuting unbelievers, social outreach, etc.

But God has had a different meaning altogether to fulfill this act of ‘worship’ that man has sought for so long, and it goes against our very human nature: SACRIFICE. Instead of relying on any tradition, we can see what the Bible’s definition of true spiritual worship is:

Romans 12:1 *Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, **which is your spiritual service of worship**. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.*

Animal nature (without God’s Spirit) has always revolved around one thing: self. The call of God is the opposite. It goes against human and animal nature (survival of the fittest, living for self). His call is to present our whole selves as a sacrifice to God – no longer living and working for ourselves.

God made man in 3 parts: body, soul, and spirit. An unregenerate person will always search to satisfy their body or their soul - seeking food, sleep, sex, companionship, entertainment, fun, happiness – everything for themselves.

A spiritual man or woman is one who lives with the totally opposite motive – to live for God in every aspect. Their heart is totally different, and that means their motives are totally different. They seek to do God’s will, and intend on laying down their lives to please God. It is an internal attitude rather than an external work. Any external work will flow from that inner attitude of “it’s all about God’s will and what pleases Him.”

One the Pharisees tried to trick Jesus by asking Him (in front of everyone) whether taxes should be paid to Caesar (the hated Roman emperor). He asked for a coin and said, ‘Whose image is on this coin?’ After they ‘Caesar’s”, He told them “Then give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s” (Matt 22:21). That statement is significant because Jesus was saying that “if something has someone’s image, it belongs to them.” And everyone there knew this one thing: All men and women have been made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). So in other words, it was like Jesus was saying “Your focus is on what you can keep for yourself that you think belongs to you, it should be on giving yourself over to God, your Creator, since you belong to Him.” Our goal in life is to give our Lord everything that belongs to Him – all of the glory, and all of ourselves. I believe the idea of “Giving ourselves over to God” is just another way of phrasing Romans 12:1 (presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice to God).

This giving all of ourselves over to God is only possible in the New Covenant, because it can only be kept in us with God’s Holy Spirit living in us. It is no more possible for us to give ourselves over to the Lord without the Holy Spirit, than it is for a deer to willingly lay down in front of a hungry Lion – it can’t do it, it’s not in its nature. A person needs to die to the old nature of “self” and be “born again” to a new nature, which places the Lord at the center. Only then can we attain to what billions and billions of people have tried to do in every nation for thousands of years, since the beginning: to truly worship God. This is what Jesus talked about when He said:

*"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.”* (John 4:23)

The question I need to ask myself is: am I living like an animal? Is my motive to gain, gain, gain for myself? Then I am not worshiping the Lord, and I am not spiritual. If I have died to my own life and risen to new life in the Spirit which has an aim to live for Him and not for myself, to cleanse myself from anything that’s displeasing to Him, then I can know that I am fulfilling John 4:23 and am a true worshiper.


# Chapter Twenty Four
## Rejoicing In The Lord'S Work, Not In Our Own Performance
*Nov 28, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=63)] 

The Pharisees had a false comfort, satisfaction and joy in this: that they had God’s law, and they obeyed it well (Luke 18:11-12). They rejoiced because they believed they were very spiritual, based on their own performance.

I’ve seen that it’s a temptation to root my joy in my current performance with God. If I'm doing well in my walk with God and feeling that I’ve been very faithful for a while, I can be happy. If not, it’s tempting to be discouraged and lose my joy.

That’s not God’s will. He wants me always to put my confidence and joy in what Jesus accomplished, not in my own performance. In other words, He wants me to rejoice in and boast in the Lord’s work at every moment, and have no confidence in my flesh:

Php 3:3 *“For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh”*

Paul goes on to say of his previous ‘great works of the flesh’:

*I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. (v8-9)*

Paul was able to rejoice that He was right with God, disregarding all of the evil AND all of the good that he had done up to that point. He was able to do what Jesus said: “Rejoice because your names are written in Heaven” (Luke 10:20). If my name is only written in Heaven when I am doing well, I should be a sad man! That would mean my salvation isn't secure (since it would come and go along with my performance)!

But praise God our righteousness is solid, unshaken – the righteousness of Jesus that He gave me as a gift. Not the righteousness that comes when I am doing well (all my righteousness is filthy rags anyways, even when I feel I’m doing well! (Isa 64:6))

If I’m rejoicing because I believe I’ve been walking faithfully, I’m basically having faith in a works gospel. Is the good news that I have done something wonderful? Or is it that God has done something wonderful?

The 'gospel' (good news) is that God has done the work to save me and my salvation is secure in His work, my righteousness is found there alone. And my joy should be rooted there, not in my own performance.


# Chapter Twenty Five
## Your Labor For The Lord Is Not In Vain
*Nov 28, 2016*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=64)] 

*“Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, **always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord**.”* (1 Corinthians 15:58)

The Bible tells us to ‘abound in the work of the Lord’ – to serve Him diligently and consistently. Many times when we serve the Lord we won’t see the outcome of that service (at least, not immediately – or maybe never in this life). Because of that, I think 1 Corinthians 15:58 is a great encouragement – “our toil is not in vain in the Lord”. Regardless of whatever outward results we see from our efforts to abound in His work, our labor is never in vain – as long as it is a labor ‘IN’ the Lord.

Just to clarify, notice that the verse does not say “your labor ‘FOR’ the Lord.” A labor ‘IN’ the Lord implies where the source of that work comes from – it is *His* labor, initiated by Him, and carried out by Him through us as we seek to do His will alone. We’re not talking about our own labor *for* the Lord – in other words – *our own* ideas of what *we* think will be great things for Him that *we* can carry out by *our* own power. The promise that the Lord gives us is that if we labor IN the Lord, it will never be in vain.

1 Peter‬ ‭4:10-11‬ *“As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.”* ‭

Our Lord Jesus lived like this. He was led by the Spirit and followed His Father’s every leading. He preached the gospel to thousands, healed them, and labored for them in the strength which God supplied. But He was either rejected or not taken seriously by almost everyone:

Matthew 11:16 *“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other children, 17 and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’*

There were towns that totally rejected the Lord and His gospel. Does that mean it was useless for them to go there? Why did God lead Jesus and the disciples to go into places and meet so many people that told them to just go away? By today's standard Jesus’ ministry on earth would have been considered a failure! Yet we know that He had the greatest life and ministry of them all!

So we should never be discouraged by a lack of visible results when we obey something the Lord has told us to do for Him. Our satisfaction should come from the fact that the Lord led us to do something, and we did it for Him because we love Him. Whatever comes after that is His business!

The church I grew up in as a child had two faithful elders who labored for decades together. I remember how humble and joyful they were. As far as I know, they never took salaries either because they worked secular jobs. As a child I remember that church was thriving in number with dozens of people. But over the years the church dwindled to barely a handful… but those two brothers kept pressing on with joy. I remember there was one elderly woman who sat at the front alone for all those years, and one day she passed away. Not long after that one of the elders passed away and within a few years, so did the other elder, along with both of their wives. It’s so rare to find a faithful church, I’ve often wondered why God did not do more with that faithful little church. Was the labor of those elders in vain, to have built a church that dwindled to almost nothing only to have the elders pass away not long after?

In the world, labor that does not produce visible results is counted as useless. A business that is not making money on a product will quickly scrap the product. But it’s not like that in God’s kingdom. God calls us to persevere and encourages us that our toil is never in vain. If the Lord puts it on our heart to do something for Him and we follow His will with the right motive, it is never in vain.

I am confident that those godly elders laid up a storehouse of treasure in Heaven because of their diligent work for the Lord, and none of it was in vain. They may not have drawn in thousands, but they immensely blessed the few believers who were there (including myself), and they knew God intimately and lived to the end of their lives doing His will. Is that not worth more than only making superficial converts in vast congregations? I am so blessed to think back to the fact that God gave me the blessing and privilege of knowing these godly men from childhood as I grew up.

Jesus once saw a poor old widow who could only give a couple of cents to God, and Jesus said her giving was counted as more in God’s eyes than anyone else (Mark 12:42-44). God does not look on the outward appearance, but on the heart. “It’s not how much you give, but how much love is in the giving.” Her little sacrifice was not in vain, and it glorified the Lord.

Imagine all the godly saints that have gone on before us, living quiet lives (1 Thess 4:11) for Jesus with all their heart, but never having major ministries or major outward accomplishments. They will be shining forever in Heaven for the Lord! And we can live a wonderful life like that too.

Paul tells us in Romans 12:1 that our spiritual “service” (labor) of worship is to present our bodies as a living and holy sacrifice. What He then does with our lives is up to Him entirely; we do not have to worry about earthly measurements of success. So if we serve the Lord our whole lives whole-heartedly, even if we never see the visible earthly results (no major ministry to show, no major stories of how God used us to save many people, no huge growth (in numbers) in our church, etc.), we can be confident in God’s promise that our life wasn’t in vain.

Our goal is not to become popular missionaries whose lives transform thousands.

Our goal is to love the Lord with all our heart and to do His will.

We don’t seek to be grand ministers for the Lord in public. We seek to be grand worshipers of Him in every aspect of our lives.

Keep diligently living for the Lord and serving Him with all your heart, abounding in the work of the Lord. Don’t worry about the lack of outward results! Your labor is not in vain.


# Chapter Twenty Six
## How Do We Humble Ourselves?
*Jan 29, 2017*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=67)] 

The Bible tells us in 1 Peter 5:6 to humble ourselves before the mighty hand of God:

“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time”

What does it mean to humble ourselves?

The best definition of this comes from the life of Jesus and the Bible tells us in Philippians 2:8 how Jesus humbled Himself:

*“He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross”*

Jesus humbled Himself by being obedient to death. Obedience and humility are always tied together. The reason is because whoever we obey, that’s who we are saying (with our actions) is the master of our life. When someone calls somebody ‘master’ they are saying ‘I am lower than you, so what you want me to do is more important than what I want to do’. That’s humility before God.

If I obey the Lord, I am saying ‘you are more important than me.’ If I obey myself, what I am really saying to God is ‘in this situation, You are not the most important person – I am. In this situation – I am the master.’ The first sin ever committed was by the devil, and it was the sin of pride. He was saying the same thing: ‘I will lift myself up above you God, I am most important.’ (Ezekiel 28:2)

An attitude of pride (‘I am most important’) always manifests itself as disobedience, because if I consider myself more important than God, then that directly implies that my will for my own life is more important than His will for my life.

The Bible says “present your members to God as instruments of righteousness” (Romans 6:13). A Christian who is humble will not disobey with his eyes because he will have the attitude that “my eyes belong to God. What He wants my eyes doing is more important than what my flesh wants them to do.” And when a Christian brother looks away from a pretty woman in order not to lust after her, he is humbling himself and saying “Lord, you are the master of my eyes, not me. My eyes bow down to you, and I am bowing down to you.” So we tell the Lord that we belong to Him by presenting ourselves and all our members to Him in humility. “My tongue belongs to you Lord so I will not speak evil, my mood belongs to you Lord, so I will not be quick to anger, my desires belong to you so I will not covet money, even my mind belongs to you - what *you* want me to think about is more important than what I want to think about.”

Obedience – presenting all our members, even our whole selves to God, is the way we say to Him: “Lord, you are everything, and I am nothing.”

If this life of obedience sounds like a terribly burdensome life, it’s not - it’s the exact opposite. It’s a celebration of what He’s done for us. Laying down our life for Him is the greatest celebration of His love we can do, and it is a joyful celebration. The wonderfully amazing thing about our Christian life with God is that unlike all the many religions of the world, this is never a burden of rules and regulations in order to attain our right standing with God (which has already been attained for us by our Lord Jesus), but simply because we love Him (1 John 5:3), and we want to please, celebrate, and live for the One who gave everything for us.


# Chapter Twenty Seven
## The Holy Spirit Strengthens
*Apr 20, 2017*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=71)] 

I’ve noticed that I sometimes encounter similar trials or temptations throughout life. But I’m encouraged when I see progress, where I’m able to handle a particular situation much more easily than I would have in previous years. When I see this I believe it is a mark that the Holy Spirit has been working in me to strengthen me over time. For example, some things that used to make me get very angry, I’m able to brush off easier. Or some things that used to disturb me and make me anxious don’t affect me like they did before, etc. It encourages me to know that He is working in me, and even though my ‘outer man is decaying, my inner man is being renewed day by day.’ My earthly body is going downhill, but by God’s grace and the power of the Holy Spirit my inner man is moving to higher levels.

The Holy Spirit is marked by power (Acts 1:8). Power means strength - strength to handle sins, temptations and the problems of life that come our way. Physically a person has to have physical strength and energy to handle the physical demands of life. But spiritually, a person has to have the Holy Spirit to meet the spiritual demands.

When a person increases in strength it means they can handle a particular weight with more ease than they could before.

A man who just starts exercising may find it extremely difficult to exercise with 50 pounds even once. But after some years of dedication in working out and sticking to it, he may find that he can easily exercise with 100 pounds multiple times. And 50 pounds now feels so light to him, that he lifts it up with little effort. This is because he has become stronger.

So greater strength doesn't mean that the weight is removed, it just means that the weight is much easier to handle than it was before. So in a sense, it has the same effect for a person as removing weight would!

This is what God does for us by the power of His Holy Spirit. He doesn’t remove all our problems; He does something better: He strengthens us in different ways in order to help us be able to overcome every temptation to sin, and to be able to endure and praise God in every trial.

It is not that He removes all temptations and difficulties in life to make our lives easier. As we rely on the power of the Holy Spirit, what used to be a strain on us and weigh us down (50 pounds worth of trials), is something we now easily handle. And so He is able to push us further and give us new weights to push. Now He can allow us to have 100 pounds worth of trials and temptations to make us even stronger.

What was the strength of grace that Jesus had? Jesus was able to have a woman wash his feet with her hair, and not be disturbed by any temptation. How do we know He was not tempted? Because if He would have been tempted He would have fled that situation and removed Himself, since God's desire for us is to 'flee temptation' (2 Tim 2:22-24), like Joseph did in Genesis 39:12.

Jesus was so strong inwardly by the Spirit that He as a single, unmarried man could have a woman right at His feet wiping them with her long hair, and not be struggling with sexual thoughts. He could easily get through that with no sexual thoughts, because He had the Holy Spirit's power in Him, strengthening Him in many ways. Maybe some of that strength was His hatred for sin being so strong. Maybe some of that strength was His pure love for this woman being so strong. Maybe some of that strength was His fear of God being so strong. I’m sure all of these contributed to the fact that the Spirit’s strength inside of Him made Him an overcomer.

And if we have the Holy Spirit in us, we will find that He increasingly gives us more strength too. He will enable us to easily get through some situations that would have been so much more of a struggle for us before, because we didn’t have His strength yet. And He gives us this strength as we seek to obey, and to lean on Him to overcome, and to be filled with His Spirit.

1 Peter 5:9-10 says regarding the devil's temptation and persecution:

*9 But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. 10 After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.*

I used to read this verse and paraphrase it like this: 'after you have suffered for a little while, God will remove the temptation/trial - it is just for a season.' But I realized that that's not what the verse says. It does not say 'after a little while God will remove your suffering'. It says that “after some time of that suffering, God will strengthen me in it.” It's not a promise that the temptation or trial will go away. It's a promise that whatever the temptation or trial is, after some time God will give me more strength so I can exercise with heavier weights without straining myself so much anymore. Isn't this a better promise than removing the situation altogether?!

How could we apply this to our personal lives? Would you rather have your children live with an average salary but be strong in their inner contentment and joy? Or would you rather help them become rich, while not having strength over discouragement and bad moods? Any sane person would say they would prefer that their children had joy and contentment with less money, rather than being rich and miserable. God is our loving Heavenly Father. He transforms us inwardly to overcome the outward struggles, rather than remove all of the outward problems while remaining a spiritual wimp.

To me, this is a great comfort for me when I see a trial or temptation persisting for a long time. He wants me strong and is making me strong. So as I fully submit to God and depend on Him, then I can trust that over time, my current issues will become easier over time by the power (strength) of His Holy Spirit. Maybe they'll still be there, but there will be more of His strength in me, and that will get me through victoriously. Praise God!

## The 'Always' Life
*Jul 10, 2017*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=73)] 

"Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus." (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)

These three verses in 1 Thessalonians 5 give me a wonderful glimpse at what God wants my life to look like all the time, regardless of if I'm at home, at work, or with my church. In whatever I'm doing it tells me to be: 1. rejoicing in Him all the time and all He has given me in Christ, 2. having a deep and meaningful conversation with Him (not primarily just talking to Him but even more importantly listening to Him), and 3. praising Him from the heart in constant gratitude.

For many of us living a life such as this when we’re so busy seems so far off. We can pray*sometimes*, and we can rejoice *sometimes*, and we can give thanks *sometimes*… but to do these things *'always', 'without ceasing'*and*'in everything'*is something that seems very difficult. We may try for a while in our own power, but then things get busy and we forget to talk to God and to praise Him. Our mind gets caught up with other things and other cares. But we agree this life sounds wonderful and we want it. We want to genuinely be praising the Lord all the time, rejoicing in Him, living in gratitude to Him, talking to Him all the time, having an inner conversation with Him all the time.

In the Old Testament, God commanded many things that could never be kept by the Israelites. The point of the law was to show them their helplessness (Gal 3:21-24)! And for those who were honest like Paul, they saw their wickedness and their need for a Savior.

But the Old Covenant is done away with and now God has provided a way to live rightly, like Jesus in every area (Romans 8:3-4). And God says to all of us in the New Covenant who are needy and confessing they need help: “according to your faith be it unto you” (Matt 9:29). **In the New Covenant we have only two limits to the height we can go in our life with the Lord: our need and our faith.**

The Apostle Paul was someone full of faith. And if you read what he wrote you can see that by the grace and power of God (and his faith), he entered into this ‘always’ life. Look at 2 Timothy 1:3, for example: “I thank God whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day.”

Paul was constantly ‘praying without ceasing’ night and day – a constant natural conversation with God, where he was praising Him and thanking Him for his brothers/sisters in Christ, and listening to Him. He entered into this ‘always’ life. And what a joy he found!

Paul’s joy was not a rapturous emotional joy where he was crying tears of joy and smiling all the time (we don’t even see Jesus doing that). But it was a deep joy of the spirit that stayed with him all the time, that drove him to live a life of gratitude before the Lord, serving Him with all his heart. He carried that joy with him. That's where this 'always' life is rooted - in the heart, where even if our mind isn't consciously talking to God at the moment, we have a desire to be ready to listen to anything He's saying. Where even if we're not outwardly singing a song of praise we have a joy and thankfulness in our heart that doesn't need to be expressed with words, maybe they are more like inward 'groans' of gratitude. These things are deep and in the heart.

When a loved one passes away, the grief is very deep. And we carry it with us. Days pass and there’s a pain that just goes with us wherever we go, and thoughts will often come to our mind of what we loved about that person and how we miss them. This grief we have drives our thoughts and our mood for some time.

In the way that deep grief stays with us after a dear one passes away, I believe the joy of the Lord stays with us in a similar way but instead of the deepest sorrow, it’s the deepest joy. It stays with us wherever we go. A deep feeling of awe in what the Lord has given us lifts us up and drives us on. “The joy of the Lord is our strength” (Nehemiah 8:10). This inner joy brings thoughts to our mind of His promises and what we hope in. And we often think of our future hope, we think of the Lord’s return and eternal life with Him. These help us put all of our problems of this life in perspective and give us an inner strength, peace and joy that no one outside of Jesus can have.

I’ve always been impressed by the godly people I’ve met, where it's evident they overflow with a joy in the Lord all the time, and easily cast off discouragement because of the truth of the cross and what it means to them, and the hope it gives them. With their life, you can see that what God did for them in Christ is bigger than anything else on earth, than any problem they have. It's their hope, and it's what they enjoy and live for.

Their example and progress where this truth has become a reality to them encourages me to press on to enter into that life. And also to pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit all the time, because after so many times of trying to accomplish the 'always' life in my own strength and failing, I know that it can only be done when God fills me with the power which comes through His Holy Spirit. Physical feats require muscles but spiritual feats require the Holy Spirit. So to live this 'always' life we have to pray with faith to be filled with the Spirit always.

To solidify our hope we have His promise that He will help us attain this high calling:

1 Thess 5:24 “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.”


# Chapter Twenty Nine
## A Desire For Understanding
*Dec 11, 2017*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=80)] 

As believers, above all, we want to know the Lord intimately, and we want to fear Him. I was blessed by this verse in Proverbs 2 that answers the question: How can we gain a knowledge of God and know what it means to fear Him?

God’s Word tells us in *Proverbs 2:3-5*, “For if you cry for discernment, Lift your voice for understanding; 4 If you seek her as silver And search for her as for hidden treasures; 5 Then you will discern the fear of the LORD And discover the knowledge of God.” (NLT)

I’ve noticed too many times I’ve made a habit of going to God merely looking for an answer to my problem. This verse challenges me to stop trying merely to find the answer to some problem (to simply 'understand' in my mind), or to find some direction that God wants me to go, but to *know* the Lord’s heart in every matter – understanding who He is, how He is, and why He does or allows certain things that come my way. That’s when I can grow in knowing the Lord and also fearing Him. I have to have the attitude that I don’t only want to know what the Lord wants me to do in situations (that’s basically what the Old Testament law was), but I want to know the Lord Himself!

We sometimes may find ourselves seeking out God’s will and not sure what He’s saying, and we can become frustrated, wondering why it’s so difficult to hear from God. I believe it’s because of this very reason: He’s testing to see who will seek Him with a whole heart to not only know what He’s speaking, but also seeking to understand what He’s speaking – and having a desire to follow the right way with the right motives and goal – fellowship with God Himself.

Jesus often spoke in parables. Sometimes He preached to a crowd of people, and only used parables and nothing else – no explanations, no Bible verses – just parables *(Matthew 13:34)*. Many people got so confused. When the disciples asked Him why Jesus spoke like this He answered them plainly:

*Matthew 13:10*And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?” 11 Jesus answered them, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.”

To the disciples it had been granted this revelation of God’s Word. To the rest it wasn’t. Was the Lord just randomly choosing who He wanted to reveal Himself to? – “I want to randomly choose this one to understand, and this one I will randomly choose not to understand”? No. There’s a characteristic God looks for when deciding who He chooses to grant this revelation to, and it’s listed in the following verses:

“For the heart of this people has become dull, With their ears they scarcely hear, And **they have closed their eyes**, Otherwise they would see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, And understand with their heart and return, And I would heal them” (*Matthew 13:15)*

The reason why it was not granted for most of the people to understand the Word of God is because they closed their eyes. These people were like teenagers who do not answer the phone when their parents are calling because they are afraid they’ll have to stop doing what they like. They want to continue to do as they like, and so they turn off their phone. These people were like this – they closed their eyes and ears to God and the result is, it says their hearts became dull. They didn’t get the truth because they didn’t want the truth. Just as the Bible says in 2 *Thessalonians 2:10* – God will allow people to be deceived (to understand nothing of the truth, but instead believe a lie) who do not love the truth.

The interesting thing is, if you turn to the parallel passage in Mark 4, you’ll see that even the disciples did not understand this parable He just told them! *Mark 4:13* And He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?"

So what is the difference between Jesus’ faithful disciples who didn’t understand, and the crowd who didn’t understand? Everyone there didn’t understand the parable of the sower. There was no difference in understanding there. What makes these disciples different than the crowd? And if no one at all understood the parables, then how could anyone be saved?!

I believe the answer lies in the 3rd time the Bible speaks of this same parable – in Luke. After Jesus was done telling this parable, it says there:

*Luke 8:9* **His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant**. 10 And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

**The only difference between the crowd, and the disciples is – the disciples sought for understanding, because they wanted to live the truth the Lord was speaking. So they proceeded to question Jesus until He told them what the parable meant.**And so Jesus was happy to explain everything, and in that way those disciples gained understanding, which resulted in life. The only difference was the disciples sought the Lord for understanding with a desire to take the Lord’s parable to heart, and the rest of the crowd was content to move on without it. And of course when the Lord sees a seeking heart, He definitely answers clearly:

*Mark 4:34* and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.

The confusing parables remained mere stories for most of the crowd, but for the disciples who sought for understanding, the parables turned into life – they turned into the knowledge of God, and the fear of God.

Because of this heart which desired understanding to know God and to live in fear before Him, Jesus said of the disciples, “Blessed are your eyes, for they see” *(Matthew 13:16)*. May He be also be able to say of us, “Blessed are your eyes.” He will be able to say that of us if we cry out to Him for understanding with the spirit of “I want to know His heart, and I want to obey Him.”


# Chapter Thirty
## The Lord'S Calming Of Us Is Much More Important Than Calming The Storm
*Dec 11, 2017*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=81)] 

*Matthew 14:**29**And He said,**“Come!”**And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.**30 But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”31 Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and \*said to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” 32 When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.*

Here Peter doubted and became afraid when he saw the wind. Doubt, and a lack of faith will cause us to be afraid of the future when looking at certain situations.

If Jesus said beforehand “Come onto the water and I will calm the wind at the right time,” maybe Peter would have been prepared and could have had faith. But this was a situation where he had no word from God. Jesus never told Peter He would keep the wind away, He only told Peter he could come out and walk too.

Sometimes when see a problem and we don’t know what God’s will is, we can start fearing the worst will happen. For example, let’s suppose I’m taking a plane flight and we hear some odd sound coming from the plane, then the thought comes to my mind that the plane could crash. We don’t have a promise in God’s Word that He will preserve His children from plane crashes, so how do we have faith and freedom from fear? If we’re honest, we don’t know absolutely what God’s will is there.

We know that God can fix any problem, but we also know that we can only have full faith for what He has promised, and so we may start to doubt. What if it’s not His will to fix my situation? What about the personal burden we’ve been carrying, and we’re not sure when, or even if it’s His will to deliver me? For example – maybe there’s rumors at the job that massive layoffs are coming and our future there is in jeopardy, or maybe it’s some physical ailment or sickness that’s persisted. There’s no promise in God’s Word (in the new covenant) that He will keep us in any particular job or cure us of any particular sickness. So can we really pray in faith for that? What will praying do?

To me, this story of Jesus and Peter walking on the water has encouraged me in situations like these. We see that Peter started walking, but then stumbled in faith when seeing the wind, and started sinking. This is like how we can start sinking into despair when we think about some problem we have.

The answer to this problem I believe is to look at what happened right when Peter cried. It says that *immediately* Jesus reached out to take hold of him and lifted him up. And I believe the important thing to notice here is that at this point the **wind has not stopped yet**. It is still windy, and stormy (the problem is still there around him), but Peter himself has been lifted up – because he cried out, “Lord save me.” Only after that, after they entered the boat did the wind stop.

This speaks one of the most crucial lessons for me as a follower of God – that God will not fix all our problems immediately when we cry out, but He immediately does something else which is much more important - He will lift *us* up when we cry out. That is by far the most important thing, much more than stopping the wind. Peter didn't need the wind to stop, he needed to stop sinking in the water, that was the main thing. He needed to stop sinking in fear, he needed to stop drifting down away from Jesus – that was much more important than any dangerous weather issue being solved. It was *Peter* that needed to be calmed, not the wind.

A man whose job is in jeopardy may not have the guarantee yet that he will stay at his job, but God can immediately free him from all fear, and comfort him with the promise that He will take care of all his needs. God did not calm the ‘layoff’ storm, but he lifted this man up out of fear. A sick person who prays may not be healed from their pain immediately, but the Lord can lift him or her out of the pit of despair and discouragement immediately – today, right now being free from doubt about whether God cares for them. A person struggling with loneliness may not find a friend or companion right away, maybe they are single, and looking for marriage, for example. They may not find a spouse for many years, but God can lift them up so that they have the grace to endure singleness with joy in fellowship with Him, and not despair thinking that “I don’t have anybody.”

This is the lesson we see when Peter is immediately lifted up, while the wind is still blowing.

Then we see that later on after Jesus and Peter entered the boat the wind was calmed (v32). The situation was fixed later, but at that point it didn’t even matter whether the wind was calmed or not because Peter was walking with Jesus in victory over the water and freedom from fear. I believe God wants to take us each to that point – where we can genuinely say “Lord, I can accept what You have for me in this situation for as long as Your will is, because You’ve lifted me up above it. I’ll accept whatever You choose for me and praise You in the meantime.”

If God can bring us to a place where we have that attitude, and to see God's faithfulness in the storm, then it's much more amazing than to have the storms and see God work than not to have them. It's like a song says, "If I'd never had a problem, I'd never know that God could solve them, and I'd have never seen what faith in God could do."

We should absolutely pray to our Father to help us in all our problems. But Peter got to the point where he could get on in perfect contentment with the wind still blowing until God fixed the problem – because Jesus was holding him up. And God can do that for us too.

## What Does It Mean To Be “In Christ”?
*Jan 11, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=82)] 

**What does it mean to be “In Christ”?**

One of my favorite verses that always encourages me is Romans 8:1 – *“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”*

The Bible often uses the phrase “in Christ”. I did a search and found that the phrase “in Christ” occurs 89 times in the New Testament. That’s a lot! So I think it’s important to know what it means to be “in Christ.”

My understanding of what it means to be “in Christ” is this: If I am in Christ, I receive the benefits of His perfect life just as if I had lived that perfect life myself.

Here are a few verses which illustrate this:

**John 17:23***I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me.*

**-Because God loves His Son Jesus with His infinite love as a Father, He loves everybody who is "in Christ" with exactly that same love**

**Eph 2:7***so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us **in Christ** Jesus.*

**-Because God lavishes His riches of grace and kindness on His perfect Son Jesus, He does the same for us, who are 'in Christ'**

**2****Cor****.****5:19***namely, that God was **in Christ** reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.*

**-Because Jesus is sinless, God sees me as sinless if I am 'in Christ'**

**Eph 1:3***Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places **in Christ**,*

**-Because Jesus owns every spiritual blessing, so do I if I am 'in Christ'**

**Eph 2:10***For we are His workmanship, created **in Christ** Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.*

**-Because Jesus’ path forever consists of doing the good will of His Father, so does mine. I am on the exact same path since I am in Him.**

Praise the Lord!

When God looks at me He doesn’t see my righteousness, He sees Jesus’ righteousness. Because there is no condemnation for Jesus, there is no condemnation for me. Because He is the Son of the Father in Heaven, I am also a son of the Father in Heaven. Because He can have pure unhindered fellowship with the Father, I can have an intimate relationship with the Father. Because He has the Holy Spirit in Him, I have the Holy Spirit in me. Because He rose again and lives forever, I will rise again and live forever. Because He owns every spiritual blessing in Heavenly places, so do I. What a miracle it is to be in Christ!

John 14:19-20 *“… because I live, you will live also. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you”*


# Chapter Thirty Two
## A Hasty Man Is Worse Than A Fool
*Mar 8, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=83)] 

**Proverbs 19:2b** “*he who hurries his footsteps errs*”

**Proverbs 29:20** “*Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him*”

Recently there was a worldwide security flaw found in almost all of the computers in the world. As a response, I'm hearing that many companies are trying to protect themselves by educating people about computer security. I recently heard a term that they are warning people not to be: a 'clicker'. They are telling people "don't be clickers." A "clicker" being someone who moves their mouse cursor around many windows and emails and websites clicking anything and everything, clicking all types of links and buttons without considering what is good to click, what is legitimate, what it will do, or what is safe. They just go ahead and click on. So many companies see that these 'clickers' are a security threat by which computer infections (viruses and malware) can infiltrate whole computer networks and cause a lot of harm to a company.

It's possible for a Christian to live similar to a 'clicker' – they live hastily. That's when they go forward in all their decisions and actions without considering what is the will of God.

**THE OPPOSITE OF THE HASTY**

What's the opposite of a hasty person? It's a person who inquires of the Lord.

This person always acknowledges that God’s will is best, and tries to live carefully and to seek God to be in His will all the time. The safest place to be in the whole universe is in the center of God’s will. A hasty person jumps around so much that maybe he will be in God’s will one second, but he’s jumping around and so he quickly falls out of the center of God’s will only to repeat the process again later. But a prudent person is patient and in frequent contact with God, always with a ‘listening’ ear in order to stay in God’s will, and away from evil.

**Proverbs 27:12** “*A prudent man sees evil and hides himself, The naive proceed and pay the penalty.*”

**THE EXAMPLE OF DAVID**

We see examples of this all over the Bible - when a person seeks the Lord in a matter, they get victory. When a person is hasty and makes decisions themselves, they are defeated. See for example David in 2 Samuel 5 - we read there that he went repeatedly to the Lord at every step to 'inquire of the Lord'. "Should we go up against the Philistines here?" The Lord directed him and gave him victory each time. Not only did He give David victory, but He gave him direction on how to get victory.

2 Samuel 5:23-25: “When David inquired of the LORD, He said, "You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. ... Then David did so, just as the LORD had commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer”

I’ve found that when I bring a burden to God to ask for help (with His will being the most important goal), that He doesn’t just give me a quick answer, He gives me peace and lifts the weight of the burden, He gives wisdom and confidence on how to go forward, and He gives me patience until I can see the outcome.

**PRACTICALLY WALKING IN HIS WILL**

I don’t believe we can practically consciously be asking God throughout the day before we take any action. “God should I tie my shoes now? God how hot should I put the sink water as I wash my hands? God should I wear a blue tie or a yellow tie?” That would be burdensome, and God’s commands are never burdensome. But we’ve heard that inquiring of the Lord is like a police car radio – there is not always words coming every single second, but it’s ‘listening’ all the time, so when the word does come through the policeman is ready to take action. And when there’s a question, he can radio out to his boss to find out what to do.

Take the blue or yellow tie example above. There may be a time when we are picking out our clothes that when we grab a shirt we feel a hesitation in our spirit. The Holy Spirit is quietly speaking something to us. Maybe we have a wrong motive. Maybe we are trying to look particularly attractive that day, maybe we are wanting to impress someone for the wrong reason. That hesitation is like the radio that has just picked up a signal. And we can bring it to the Lord, “Father, is there a wrong motive in me? Please cleanse me of that! I’ll wear the most unattractive shirt today!” What a way we can enter into such a easy walk with God! It’s not burdensome at all, but a very natural and easy life with Him if we are truly surrendered to our own will.

**THE GODLY ARE CAREFUL**

I've noticed one characteristic of the godliest people I've met in my life is they live like this all the time. They live always eager and ready to hear the Lord and heed anything He’s putting on their spirit. It’s like there is frequently a 'stop sign in front of them. They are always so careful - they are carefully considering the way they speak, what they speak, the actions they take, the decisions they make, where their eyes are wandering, what their hands are doing. They are the opposite of hasty 'clickers' who hurriedly take thousands of actions a day without even one thought of considering what God wants. They've made such a habit of it, that it has become an attitude of heart in them. This lifestyle is part of them. They may not necessarily stop and say any specific words in the heat of a moment where they have to make a sudden decision. But their heart has a surrendered desire that feels 'Lord I want to go the way you want, help me choose that way in everything.'

*"But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil*" - **Hebrews 5:14**

## Heap Burning Hot Coals On Your Enemy'S Head
*Apr 2, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=84)] 

Heap Burning Hot Coals On Your Enemy's Head

**AN EXPERIENCE**

Some time back, I remember I was driving down the road and someone who was driving slowly in the lane next to me cut in front of me very fast, causing me to hit my brakes hard so I didn't rear-end him. I honked my horn in a very angry way to show my disapproval, even though honking didn't do any good for anyone's safety since the incident was already over. I was just honking out of revenge. And immediately I had a picture in my mind. It was an image of the devil rejoicing. I saw that he succeeded in what he was trying to do - to stir me up to sin through the actions of another person. At that moment, the anger that I had against that person disappeared! It disappeared right away because I was reminded of the verse:

**WHO ARE WE FIGHTING?**

*"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places." Ephesians 6:12*

This person who cut me off was not my enemy at all - the devil was my enemy. Ultimately, he's behind the scenes pulling the world down into sin. Maybe this person cut me off after the devil drove them to do it at that moment, or maybe it was not a whisper from the devil, maybe it was years of the devil prodding them to live in selfish ways and that selfishness was just manifested in that moment. I don't know. But I do know that the devil was behind the scenes trying to get to me - and this person who cut me off was, in a way, a victim who was being used by Satan. And he is the same as me - a sinner. I shouldn't be surprised. After all, haven't I cut off people in the exact same selfish way?! Yes. Satan has been trying to pull down every person in sin since the beginning of the world. I shouldn't be surprised at that - but I can use that verse of Ephesians 6:12 to re-aim my struggle. Not against selfish people I encounter, but against the devil himself.

How do I do that?

After I saw this image of the devil rejoicing, and of my Savior's sad face, I was also reminded of the verse "Resist the devil and he will flee from you" (***James 4:7***). I felt that God gave me the ability to repent immediately, and whole-heartedly, and in an instant, my Lord was rejoicing, and the devil was upset. Praise God! And the Lord enabled me to feel some sympathy for this other person who cut me off - maybe they were late for something important. Maybe they've had a really hard day.. maybe a really hard life. He's been oppressed by Satan like the rest of us. Let me pray for him.

**TURNING THE TABLES**

And the Lord showed me that this was how I could turn the tables on Satan. The devil can stir up others in my life against me, and if I respond in a Christ-like way - then God is glorified, Satan is shamed, and his whole effort to stir me up to sin and shame the Lord has backfired on him! Praise the Lord. It's like he has thrown a grenade at us which was about to explode, but we picked it up and threw it back at the gates of hell. The attack has now turned from us back on to him!

**HOT COALS ON YOUR REAL ENEMY**

And I got new light on this amazing verse in Romans 12 that I like to keep with me now:

*Romans 12:20 “But if your enemy is hungry, feed him, and if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.*

If someone on earth wrongs me, they may be considered my earthly enemy. But they are not my ***real*** enemy according to ***Ephesians 6:12.*** My real enemy is the devil. So this verse is so clear and so alive to me now, and I paraphrase it like this:

"If my EARTHLY enemy wrongs me and does me evil, do good to him in return. In that way, I will be throwing burning hot coals at my real enemy, my SPIRITUAL enemy - which is the devil."

Would you like to be in the war with Jesus and fire hot burning coals at the devil (the same coals he was trying to attack you with)? Then you must do good to the people who treat you the worst, and love them. Overcome evil with good (***Romans 12:21***).

**CONCLUSION**

My exhortation is this - never look down at others on this earth and anything they do to me without also seeing that Satan is scheming to try to pull them down. God has so much mercy and compassion for sinners, and sympathizes with ones who are enslaved to sin and to Satan. I always want to have the same compassion and be fighting not flesh and blood, but my real enemy and God's enemy, which is the devil himself.

## 4 Distractions To Devotion
*May 2, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=90)] 

In ***1 Corinthians 7:35***, Paul uses a phrase in which he expresses to the Corinthians his desire for them. The phrase is “undistracted devotion.” He used it in reference as a reason for some single people to remain single, if God gives them the grace to do that. But I believe that the same principle can apply to anyone – that our desire should be as far as possible to beware of distractions, things that get in the way of our devotion to the Lord.

What is the opposite of devotion?

Maybe devotion has many opposites, but the one that the Lord has been speaking to me about is that the opposite of devotion is *distraction*.

For example, imagine if a teenage boy was devoted to swimming and set his mind on winning in the Olympics. But then this boy got a girlfriend and he started spending all his time with her. You wouldn’t say he was *devoted* to swimming anymore, you’d say he was *distracted.* So distraction, in that way, I believe is the opposite of devotion.

And I’ve seen the devil’s tactics in trying to distract me in my own walk with God in different ways. And his end goal is not necessarily to get me to stop calling myself a 'Christian’. His ultimate goal is to distract me from LOVING the Lord. The devil doesn’t care whether or not I call myself a Christian – the question for him is, can I stop this guy from loving Jesus and from knowing God’s love? If so, then he’s succeeded. That’s the real distraction.

***Matthew 24:12** Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.*

Jesus is basically saying here that there are only going to be 2 groups of people in the end: those who withstood and still have love, and those who don’t.

So the devil wants to remove the love, and one way is by distract - and I wanted to share 4 distractions I’ve noticed can come in and keep me from loving the Lord and being fully devoted to Him:

### 1. Rules and Legalism

I’ve noticed the devil is constantly working to reduce my Christianity to rules - because if he does that, then that means the love is lost and he’s succeeded. I’ve seen that I can feel pretty good about myself if I’m sticking to a disciplined schedule and doing all the outward Christian things I’m supposed to, not having any external sins – basically obeying the 10 commandments pretty well (similar to how the rich young ruler approached Jesus). I can judge my life saying to myself, "I’m walking pretty well with God right now" because of that. But that’s like saying the goal of a family is to eat healthy - not eating poison, to make it to school and work on time without getting into an accident, to be educated without going homeless. Those are all good things, but it has nothing to do with the goal! The goal of a family is love in the family! In the home, the goal is not, “don’t drink poison.” The goal is “love one another” – and the reason you don’t drink poison is so you can go on living and loving!

It’s the same goal in our life with God – a love life. So a religion without love is pointless.

The Pharisees had religion oozing out of their ears, but their hearts were totally dry toward God and toward everybody else. They had no mercy, no compassion, no love, no connection with God at all.

The whole point of all of this is love - for us to be able to share a love life with God and each other.

***1 Timothy 1:5** “The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart”*

Religion and teaching and rules without love is worthless.

### 2. Our Problems

I’ve noticed I can be totally preoccupied and distracted by my problems - having a tendency to think about them all time, instead of God. I’ve found though that the problems don’t go away when I try to grit my teeth stop thinking about them… they usually just stay there!

So what do we do if we just can't stop thinking about them? If our mind is being tormented one moment after the next with this issue here, that issue there (almost like our mind is in prison), what do we do? I’ve seen that if there’s some problem I just can’t get out of my mind, instead of trying to not think about it, I should pray about it! That's the way God gave us for this:

***Philippians 4:6-7**– “Be anxious for nothing, instead bring everything to God and pray with thanksgiving, and He will give you His peace which guards your heart and your mind.”* The problems which torment our mind will go away when we bring them to the Lord and praise Him in faith that He is in control despite all the chaos which is happening in our life. And if the problems come back to torment our mind, what do we do then? Then we go to Him again! And we do this as many times as we need to. And the best part is – the Lord uses this process to keep us close to Him. Praise the Lord for that!

### 3. Distracted by money

***Proverbs 23:4*** says ‘Do not weary yourself to gain wealth, cease from your consideration of it’

We can choose to weary ourselves to make money, and probably succeed. Our bank account will be full – but our heart will be totally empty.

I remember an instance where I was racking my brain, feeling guilty because I knew I could be saving money on something, and this went on for some time. I started praying about it and I felt the Lord say “The love of money is much more serious than spending a little too much on something. This has gotten to the point to be a distraction from your devotion to Me… just let it go.” And I got so much peace after that, I felt so free! I was wearying myself to try to save some money, but the Lord helped me when I went to Him. I think saving money and being frugal is important, because it's God's money. But even frugality can be done with the wrong motive - to cling on to money.

“Don’t weary yourself to gain wealth” – we can weary ourselves by pursuing money or weary ourselves by clinging onto it. Either way, it’s a distraction from what’s really important and it’ll pull us away from the Lord. “We can’t serve God and money.”

### 4. All the obligations of life

***Luke 10:41****“But the Lord answered and said to her (Martha), ‘Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things; 42 but only one thing is necessary’”*

Getting our heart entangled (***2 Timothy 2:4***) in the many obligations of life can be a distraction to devotion (it could be work related, home related, or even church related). I’ve always looked at this passage here and saw it as Martha’s chance to get better, she could improve from here by prioritizing her relationship with Jesus from here on out – this instance was just one instance of her getting distracted but there was a hope for her after this.

But I believe the Lord may say this same word to millions and millions of people on the last day. Imagine someone’s standing before His throne, and He doesn’t say these words in the *present* tense like He says here to Martha (“you ***are*** worried and bothered... only one thing ***is*** necessary”), He will say it in the *past* tense – “you ***were*** worried and bothered with so many things… only one thing ***was***necessary.. it’s too late now though. Your life was wasted.”

What a sad end! I never want the Lord to say to me on that day in the *past*tense about my life that I was worried and bothered about so many things, and missed the one thing necessary.

Jesus Himself is telling us here what the single most important and necessary thing in all of life is! I don’t ever want to miss that.

### Conclusion

Satan desperately wants to remove the love of God in our life, so he’s trying with all his might to distract us. He turns Christianity into a religion, “Let’s make your life about the rules and laws.” Then the love will be gone. He says to us, “Focus primarily on fixing all the problems of your life, and handling all your big plate of obligations,” then the love will be gone. Or, “Let’s seek out money and prosperity,” and then he knows the love will be gone.

His goal is to take the love away. Don’t ever lose the love! We can’t let our love get cold with these distractions.

Jesus said there are only going to be 2 groups of people in the end: those who withstood and still have love, and those who don’t, and I have faith that by God’s grace He will help me to withstand all of the worries of life, and of Satan’s distractions and to love the Lord with a fiery love until the end, without being distracted from the only really necessary thing in life.

## When We Are Angry
*Jul 6, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=97)] 

![](images/97.jpg)

Anger is something that I never took seriously for a long time, and I believe most Christians don't see it as a sin, they see it as a weakness.

PUT AWAY ALL ANGER
 But if I look at verses like: “Put away all anger” (Ephesians 4:31) and “The wrath of man doesn’t produce the righteousness of God” (James 1:20), then I have to confess that anger is not as harmless or innocent as I thought it was.

This must change my approach when I feel wrath rising in me toward someone who's sinning against me or hurting me in some way, neglecting me or irritating me - at coworkers or family or kids or friends or whoever it is - I want to take that really seriously.

ANGER IS BLINDING

Matthew 18 tells the story of man who was so angry that he choked (v28) one of his fellows by the throat because he owed him some money. This same man himself had just been forgiven $10 billion by some else, but he was so blinded by his anger over the $1000 someone else owed him that he forgot about it. That’s how blind anger can make us to our own spiritual condition and sin in the heat of a moment. Anger is blinding! If we want to see clearly, we will seek the Lord to deliver us from this type of selfish anger that makes our blood boil.

Someone once said - 'Unforgiveness is like drinking poison and hoping your enemy dies'. That's exactly right. Being angry and holding something against someone does nothing evil to them, but it definitely does something evil to the one who’s boiling with anger.

THE HOPE
 But there’s an encouragement for us who do struggle with anger, snapping in anger or holding it against others - God can take that anger away and change us to be like Jesus, so we don’t become out of control with anger anymore.

JAMES AND JOHN EXAMPLE
 Jesus gave some of His disciples names, to Peter Jesus called him ‘rock’, which is nice - Peter must have felt pretty good to get a name like that! But to James and John Jesus called them sons of thunder (Mark 3:17), that doesn’t sound very flattering. It doesn't say in the Bible why He called them that but most it's likely because they were passionate and sometimes angry people – we get a glimpse of this in Luke 9:54 - when the Samarian village didn't welcome Jesus and so they wanted to call down fire from heaven on them!

But see what work God did in them. James was the first disciple to die for Jesus (no doubt he gave his life without fighting or arguing back), and John became known as the apostle of love, writing so much about love in the epistles.

The moral of the story I see here is that God can take an angry person and change them, He can turn them around to make them full of deep love and patience.

Romans 6:14 promises us that "Sin shall not be master over you." If we've failed again and again, consistently snapping in anger, only later on to see our foolishness - if we're sick and tired of being mastered by wrath like this over and over, then we can see God's promise here and confess that with His grace anger need not be master over us anymore.

In the next blog I would like to also address another side of anger – not when we ourselves are angry with someone else, but when someone else is angry with us.


# Chapter Thirty Six
## When Others Are Angry With Us
*Jul 11, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=98)] 

![](images/98.jpg)

Sometimes we run into situations where people get really angry with us. Even when we’re young we experience that. There are fights with siblings at home, in school there are bullies, or cruel friends, for example. When we get older maybe coworkers or family get angry at us and may not speak to us for months or even years. Maybe we did something wrong that's our fault, maybe we sinned against them. Or maybe it's not primarily our fault, but something happened and they are furious with us about it.

It can cause us to get angry back, or to feel sad or anxious if they're not forgiving us, or to look down on them because we feel they're being so ungodly for being angry with us. None of that is God’s will.

What do we do when someone is angry with us?

I believe the first thing is to HUMBLE OURSELVES. And part of humbling ourself is: we should be the first one to seek restoration.

In an argument the most spiritual one is the one to apologize and seek restoration. If I want to follow Jesus, I must be the one to seek restoration first.

In Matthew 5:23-24 Jesus said that if our brother is angry with us, we should go try to reconcile with him and make peace before we come to God. Apologize, make it right, try to reconcile - maybe we were in the fault. Even if we weren’t in the fault, we can still seek restoration… maybe we even have to apologize for something that wasn’t our fault! I believe that’s the heart of Jesus who died for many sins that weren’t His – seek reconciliation even if it means we must die to ourselves. It doesn't guarantee that the other person will accept our apology, but the question is, have we done all in our power to restore peace:

Romans 12:18 – *“As much as depends on you live in peace with all men.”*

Another thing I’ve seen is that part of humbling myself is to remember how much I've been forgiven by God, and how much mercy He's showering me with every moment.

For example, one of the things that helps me when I feel angry with something my child has done to disobey me, is to remember that my anger is more serious than my child's disobedience, because I’m older and I know better! God has told me of His love and mercy and forgiveness, and I know very well how I've been disobedient to God… so when I feel really angry with my children over their disobedience to me, it helps me to remember – it’s *me* first and foremost who needs grace and mercy from God more than they do.

If we've done all we could to reconcile with the other person and they're still angry with us, it's possible that it can make us anxious, upset, or tempt us to get angry back at them. I’ve sometimes felt very frustrated with others in situations like this when they are not quick to forgive me. I’ve learned that I have to find my rest and strength in God alone - His love and approval is the only thing that matters.

One great example of this is David:

1 Samuel 30:6 *Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters. **But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God**.*

Our Father’s love is what we stand on, not the love or approval of anyone else. His approval and love is all we need to be strengthened.

If someone’s not talking to me, I can be encouraged by the fact that God still is! If someone’s holding my sin against me even after I've repented, I don't have to worry, because God isn't! God’s not holding my sin against me anymore, that’s infinitely more important than if anyone else is holding my sin against me.

I've noticed though that if others are angry and don’t forgive us immediately or respond to us seeking restoration, we don’t just give up on them right away. We have to be patient with them like God is with us. We have to allow them to cool down if we've apologized and they haven't forgiven us yet. It's like cooking on a barbeque - you put coals on it and you light them, and there are big flames burning for a while. You can't cook on it yet - you have to wait for the flames to die down to be able to cook and be productive with those coals. In the same way sometimes you have to let the fires of anger in another person die down before talks can be profitable. It may be that God is trying to teach me patience with others just like He’s patient with me.

The Bible says “Do not repay evil for evil, but repay evil with good” (1 Peter 3:9). If we want to be like Jesus, there’s no better way than to repay evil with good, rather than evil in return. Repay hostility with gentle words (Prov 15:1). Repay another’s grudge with patience and kindness. This was the story of Jesus’ life – coming to lay down His life for a world that despised Him. He’s the One we look to.

*“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”* Hebrews 12:3 NASB

We can be encouraged by looking to Jesus and seeing how gentle He is, how much hostility He endures with patience and mercy.

May God help us to master every ounce of anger in ourselves by the power of His Spirit, and to be full of love toward others (including our enemies), wise in our responses, patient and merciful when others are angry with us.


# Chapter Thirty Seven
## Luke'S Love For Theophilus
*Jul 24, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=99)] 

![](images/99.jpg)

I was encouraged reading just the first view verses of the book of Luke:

Luke 1:3 *“It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; 4 so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught”*

Luke loved this brother Theophilus so much that he took the time to write the whole book of Luke, just for this one brother to know exactly what he'd been taught. He even went on to write another whole book for him (Acts 1:1)! Apparently Theophilus was a brother who already believed, but Luke wanted to strengthen his faith. It must have taken a long time to write these books, and Luke was a physician - a very profitable and helpful job. But he disregarded the time it would take and all the things he could have been doing in the meantime, and took these pains even for this one brother. Theophilus already believed, couldn’t Luke have written to many unbelievers, saving many of the lost? He could have, but that was not the burden God gave him. He had an intense love for his brother that God put in his heart (as He does when He gives us the Holy Spirit - Romans 5:5), and so he took the time to write these things for him.

When I think of what it means to build the church I often think of 'wide' ministry, which reaches many people all at once (like preaching and teaching). But the heart of God is one which is willing to take great pains even for a single one (like a shepherd leaving 99 sheep to go after 1 lost sheep – which, by the way Luke happened to write about! – Luke 15:3-7). Praise God He did that for us, having that 'narrow' burden for us. I hope to have that heart too. Any time we are overwhelmed with thoughts of "I'm not doing enough for the church", I'm encouraged to look and see - am I at least doing something for somebody out of care for them? God never called us to be everything to everyone, only to take the one or few burdens at a time He has for us, to help carry another person through.

We can’t be aware of all the needs in the church, but can we be aware of at least one need of someone else and commit to pray for it, to check in with them and see how they're doing? I think anybody can do that. And the Lord has made it very simple for us, that we can focus on those few burdens carefully, giving 'quality', not 'quantity' to the church. Giving ourselves *fully* somewhere, not *a little bit* of ourselves everywhere. And the beauty of the church is, if everyone is tending to their few burdens carefully, the Holy Spirit will coordinate so that *all* the needs in the church are met (Ephesians 4:16). But if I'm not faithful with the little God has given me, then someone else may be missing out until God calls another to take on what I should have been doing. Luke is an outstanding example of a man who took extreme pains for one other brother, and his faithfulness has gone on (he never knew it would) to bless millions of others for two thousand years since then. Luke is an amazing example for us to follow in the heart and love of God in building the church.


# Chapter Thirty Eight
## Waiting For God'S Will
*Aug 16, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=100)] 

![](images/100.jpg)

Luke 4:9 *And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; 10 for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning You to guard You,’*

The devil was tempting Jesus here to do something crazy (to throw Himself off of a building), so that the angels would have to come save Him. My guess is, the temptation for Jesus was if that He could see angels helping Him then that would validate that He was God's Son - He'd no longer have to just live in faith that He was. Jesus had performed no miracles yet, and so Satan must have consistently been trying to tempt Him to doubt that He was God's Son (v3), because if the devil could make Jesus doubt in that, then he would get Him to sin. We must never doubt in the fact that we are God's child and secure in His love.

Jesus rejected this temptation by Satan to compel angels to come and help Him, but then immediately after the temptation what was the first thing that happened? The angels came to help and minister to Him (Matt 4:11)! Jesus was patient and what He could have gotten outside of God's will, with patience and obedience in faith, He received it anyways. Satan is always trying to rush us and make us act in fear and haste, rather than in faith. It's foolish to try to seek things outside of God's will, when if we're just patient we'd see that God provides them at the right time. For example - God will give us the right job without having to lie on our resume, He will give the right marriage to single people without having to rush or marry outside of His will, He will give wisdom for the right word or course of action without having to rush and speak or act quickly. We just need two things: faith that God will help us because we are His children, and secondly, we need patience in His timing for the provision.

May we be imitators of all those like Jesus who, "by faith and patience have inherited His promises" (Hebrews 6:12)


# Chapter Thirty Nine
## The Humility Of Mephibosheth
*Sep 10, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=6)] 

![](images/6.jpg)

Lamentations 3:39 - What is man or any mortal to complain about anything in light of his sins?

In this verse, the Bible commands us never to complain about anything because we have no right to "in light of our sins". As sinners, we have to see that we don’t deserve anything – all the good that we have is only because of God’s mercy and grace bestowed upon undeserving sinners. We must develop an attitude that we don’t deserve anything, and that will keep us from having a complaining and murmuring heart.

There’s a wonderful example of a man in the Bible who had an attitude like this named Mephibosheth.

David once had a very close friend named Jonathan (who was King Saul’s son). The bond between them was ‘stronger than the love between man and a woman’ (2 Sam 1:26). Sadly, Jonathan was killed and the friendship between David and Jonathan was cut short. But Jonathan left behind a son named Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth was a crippled man who became this way because he was dropped when he was a child (2 Sam 4:4). After David became king, he remembered that his beloved friend Jonathan had a son and for Jonathan’s sake he was going to take Mephibosheth in. Mephiboseth was overjoyed, but reluctant because of two reasons:

1. He recognized how much his grandfather Saul and his household had wronged King David. In his eyes, he was just as responsible as they were (2 Sam 19:28).

2. He recognized that he was worthless before the King (2 Sam 9:8). He could do nothing useful for King David that the King couldn’t have done for himself.

Because Mephiboseth recognized these things about himself, let’s look at a few characteristics that resulted from this:

**1. Mephiboseth considered himself not worthy to deserve anything:**

*2Sam 9:7-8 - David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly." Again he prostrated himself and said, "What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?"*

He had a very low opinion of himself in light of who he was in the presence of, and confessed that he had no right for anything from the King.

**2. Mephibosheth did not complain about anything because he had been given so much already:**

*2Sam 19:28 "For all my father's household was nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have yet that I should complain anymore to the king?"*

One temptation we can often have is to compare ourselves to others in order to make ourselves feel like we deserve something. But Mephiboseth was not like that. He could have looked down on his family and said that he was better than they were. But instead he accepted the guilt along with his family and realized his low position. And so he recognized that he had no right to ask of or complain about anything to King David.

**3. Mephibosheth’s only desire was the good of King David, who had been so merciful to him.**

He was in the midst of vast wealth and comfort, but he did not desire wealth and comfort. His only desire was that this merciful king who treated him so well would be safe:

*2Sam 19:29-30 - So the king said to him, "Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, 'You and Ziba shall divide the land.'" Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house."*

We can take these wonderful lessons for ourselves if we recognize like Mephibosheth, that we are spiritual cripples. We can do nothing for God that He cannot do for Himself – we are not only slaves, we are UNWORTHY slaves (Luke 17:10). Not only this, we are sinners who are responsible for crucifying and causing so much grief to our Lord, just as Mephibosheth took responsibility for his household causing so much grief to David. And if we recognize these things and take them to heart, then like Mephibosheth we will not consider ourselves worthy of deserving so much extra in life. (God may give it to us, nevertheless in that case we will maintain the attitude that we don’t deserve it). We will accept the good from God, but not complain about the trouble (Lam 3:38, Job 2:10) because even the trouble in life is for our good and coming from God's gracious hand (Romans 8:28). And our highest desire will be for the good of our merciful King, who showed us so much grace when we didn’t deserve it. Praise our loving Father for having such mercy on spiritual cripples!


# Chapter Forty
## Don'T Lose Your First Love
*Sep 17, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=7)] 

![](images/7.jpg)

In Revelation 2:1-7, Jesus has a word for the church of Ephesus. This was a church that had the privilege (a few decades earlier) of having the apostle Paul stay with them for 3 years (Acts 20:31). Now, several years later, Jesus commends them because they persevered through some very hard times (Rev 2:3), and were strict on evil men/false teachers and they preserved good doctrine (v 2, 6). Yet, all of this was useless because they had forgotten the greatest commandment – to love God with all their heart (Matt 22:37).

*But I have this against you, that you have left your first love (Rev 2:4)*.

Despite all the good teaching, the history of fellowship with godly apostles, and the difficult trials that they successfully endured; they still lost their longing for God. This tells me how seriously I must aim to maintain my devotion to the Lord.

Recently I had a point where I felt myself growing cold toward my First Love. When I realized this, this verse came to mind (Rev 2:4), but I forgot what Jesus had said to the Ephesian church after verse 4. I knew that Jesus did give them some direction on exactly what to do. Since I couldn't remember what it was, I turned to Revelation 2 and read the solution that Jesus gave in the next verse:

*Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place--unless you repent. (Rev 2:5)*

This verse tells me that if I lose my first love, I need to remember where I’ve fallen from, and do the things I used to do – back during times when I’ve truly longed for Him more than I currently do. I picture it as a married couple who remember back to the early days when they would desire to spend all their time together, hold hands as they walked down the street, and talk to each other about anything and everything. Similarly, I can remember many of the times I had with God in the early days - how eager I was to get away from the ‘rat race’, and just spend time with Him. I realized that these were the "deeds" that Jesus was referring to - the effortless passion and choices to be in fellowship with Him that I had in the early days.

I never want to lose that hunger for God. So I must take Jesus’ advice and repent and remember where I’ve fallen from. I need to “do the deeds I did at first,” coming back to the basics – being a child who is needy for his Father and longing to be with Him. Every believer should be like a child in this way, but over time we must learn to do it with consistency. Children often have a wonderful eagerness, but a terrible inconsistency because they are immature. Maturity is marked by consistency. My desire is to always maintain the eagerness of a little child who is attached to his Father and always wants to be around Him, but also to have the consistency of a mature adult.

Another thing that I realized is that distraction plays a huge part in keeping my love for the Lord stoked. The moment I start to become too interested in something else, it distracts me from what’s really important. If the devil can’t make us fall into situations that are sinful, he’ll prod at us with worldly activities and cares which are lawful, but not profitable - to the point that we are overindulging and totally distracted from the things of God.

These are the thorns that Jesus talked about that choke the word (Matt 13:22). And these surprisingly are not always just obvious things like worshiping sports or becoming obsessed with work or some hobby (though these can be thorns as well for some people). In my experience they can even be seemingly profitable things like becoming so caught up with studying certain things in the Bible - like the end times, apologetics, politics, or prying into certain other mysteries that God chose not to reveal to us (Deut 29:29). I remember hearing about groups of people who would have debates on such pointless issues like how many angels could fit on the head of a pin! Maybe it seems like godly debate because ‘angels’ are in the bible and we can feel godly talking about them, but the devil knows the answer to this question much better than us, and it did NOTHING to preserve his love and loyalty to God!

We also can be people who can have “Christian” distractions, who are caught up with serving in some areas (music, ministry, etc). These are wonderful things, but they can make us lose our first love if they are not put in second place where they should be. The story of Martha and Mary clearly teaches this to us (Lk 10:38-42). Any distraction that draws us away from simple longing for God should be cut back, or taken out altogether until we can be disciplined enough to be rooted and grounded in God’s love most of all.

I also wanted to make it clear that we do not measure our love for God primarily by our emotional feelings for Him. Sometimes we may experience feelings of euphoria for our Lord, where we are determined by the grace of God to give up everything for Him. Other times we may weep bitterly in prayer or during a song. It’s true that we may have emotional extremes when seeking God, but we all know from experience that it’s only a matter of time before these emotions calm down. It’s not that emotional feelings for the Lord are bad… it’s just that they are unreliable. If I choose only to follow God when I’m on an emotional high, I will have a very pitiful Christian experience. It will be similar to the Israelites in the wilderness who wanted to follow God at certain times, and then at other times they desired to go back to Egypt and back into slavery! So our emotions should not define our love for God, but the bible does tell us what real love for God is:

*For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. (1 John 5:3)*

What does keeping God’s commandments have to do with loving God? For many years this was confusing to me because I noticed that I could often obey God without even thinking about Him. I realized that it’s possible to obey God’s commands simply because I know it’s the right thing to do. So how can we tie in our obedience of God's commands with our love for Him?

Recently God has given me some light on this, and it has changed my view of sin and obedience. He has allowed my heart to see more clearly that even though Christ paid for every one of my sins on the cross, sin still grieves Him and causes Him pain whenever I commit it. Every sin that is committed (breaking God’s commands) is so evil to God that it deeply hurts Him and grieves Him (Ephesians 4:30). Jesus suffered the wrath of God on the cross, so that He could forever take on the punishment that I deserve. But God still deeply grieves even today every single time I sin. Sin was not free 2000 years ago, and sin is not free now! It hurt Jesus when He was on the cross, and it still hurts God today every time we sin.

I can know my love for God is pure when I don’t want to grieve Him. Thus, my love for God is defined by me having a hatred of sin, which is a desire to not grieve God even one bit. Real love is choosing rather to suffer ourselves, than to let the Object of our affection suffer instead (our Lord). This is exactly what Jesus said His love was like: “Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).

* I'd rather take the pain that comes with denying my self-will and not getting my way, than to grieve God.
* I’d rather hold my tongue and let my ego be killed, than to lash out in anger and gain some satisfaction in my flesh, but cause God to grieve at the same time.
* I’d rather do work which I’m not required to do and be a servant cleaning up someone else’s mess, rather than rebel against my co-workers and have an “it’s not my job” attitude. A little bit of extra work may make me tired, but I should prefer that to disappointing my Father in Heaven.

God suffered and gave up what was most valuable to Him for me. And I want to give up something of value to Him. From God's Word, I see that what is of real value to God is to choose to suffer in the flesh myself (by not getting my way) so that God can be glorified.

So as individuals and as a church, let us have the same attitude as David who had the right heart when he said, “I won’t give to God that which costs me nothing.” (2 Sam 24:24).


# Chapter Forty One
## Patiently Bear Your Cross
*Sep 25, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=8)] 

![](images/8.jpg)

1 Peter 4:12-13 “Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the - revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation”

We should recognize that every fiery trial that comes to us in life is not a coincidence, a random occurrence of bad luck. God has a very specific purpose for it and He is content much of the time to not show us what that purpose is until after the trial has passed. Jesus’ fiery trial was the cross, and he bore that cross His whole life, knowing that eventually He was going to have to suffer the torment of being separated from His Father. He lived 33 years with that knowledge and never once did He fall into despair and give up. He calls us to follow His example and patiently bear our cross as well – denying ourselves in the trials and temptations of life without falling into discouragement or giving up.

Luke 9:23 “And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.”

Satan tries to use different schemes to keep us from being cross-carriers. The following is a list of a few of them that I have noticed:

1. Satan tries to make us feel sorry for ourselves that we have such a large cross:

When Jesus was about to go to the cross, Satan tried to use Peter to make Jesus feel sorry for Himself:
Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid [it,] Lord! This shall never happen to You." (Matt 16:22)
But Jesus knew who was speaking through Peter – “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's”(Matt 16:23)

Here Peter must have felt pretty good about himself, like he had Jesus’ best interest in mind – “Jesus, don’t go die, that’s terrible, you don’t deserve that, you are too valuable!” Satan no doubt wanted Jesus to “walk away sad” like the rich young ruler, bewildered that God would call Him to give up such a thing! Self-pity is a huge stumbling block to God’s will, and it’s very deceptive.

When something difficult happens to us, the devil will often whisper, “Why is God letting this happening to you? You don’t deserve that!” Then we may find ourselves wallowing in sorrow for a long time, our whole world revolving around our problems instead of around God and what He has done for us. If we find ourselves stuck in a pit of self-pity that is paralyzing us from doing God’s will, it’s because like Peter we have set our minds on man’s interests, not on God’s (verse 23). If we have our minds set on God, then we can have peace no matter what cross we have to carry. The Earthly-focused mind is death, but a Heavenly focused mind is the key to peace (Rom 8:6).

Romans 8:6  "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace"

2. Satan gets us to compare our cross with others:

After He was resurrected, Jesus indicated to Peter that he was going to die (John 21:18). Peter’s first reaction was to wonder if others were going to have the same fate (v 21). His thought must have been “how is it fair that I would die, but others would get to live?” So Peter asked Jesus about this:

John 21:21-22 “So Peter seeing him \*said to Jesus, “Lord, and what about this man?” Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!"

Jesus’ answer to Peter was basically “don’t worry about him, just follow me!”

Satan tries to distract us by making us jealous that other people have it easier than we do, making us wish we were in their shoes, and wonder why they have it so easy when we’ve been dealt a bad hand in life. We’ve got to cast down those thoughts away from our mind immediately and not concern ourselves with how much suffering we have compared to everybody else. We must look only straight forward to Jesus – and we will see our beloved Savior who for us carried the weight of the world on His cross. If we have such a clear view of Jesus’ cross then we will see how tiny our cross really is. When we have that perspective then like Paul we will call whatever trial we have in life ‘light affliction’ (2 Cor 4:17). Don’t be discouraged if others seem to have an easy life when yours is so difficult. Praise God for the privilege to have some type of cross because it’s a privilege to be like Jesus in that way! “To the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing” (1 Pet 4:13).

3. Satan tempts us throw down our cross, or at least make it lighter:

Job’s wife told him “curse God and die!” (Job 2:9) Job disregarded the discouragement that the devil tried to throw his way. To his wife Job had a wonderfully simple reply, “you speak as a foolish woman, should we accept good from God but not adversity?”

Satan was trying to use Job's wife to convince Job to throw down his cross by killing himself. Many times he will try to convince us to come up with some scheme to get rid of our cross, or at least to make it more bearable. Married people will hear whispers of ‘divorce’ or ‘harden your heart’ and single men burning with lust will hear whispers like "pornography", or "marry an unbeliever." Anything to get us to lighten the load of our cross! We have to remind ourselves of the foolishness of these schemes to lighten our loads. God has chosen the perfect weight of cross for us:

1 Corinthians 10:13 “… God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.”

God chose the weight of our cross, and we shouldn’t try to change it. Instead, we should be content to patiently bear the weight of our cross and keep following Jesus.

4. Satan tries to convince us that our cross is so huge that we cannot bear it:

Satan wants everybody to think life is so terrible for us that we will not make it through. He tries to make us complain to God that our cross is too big and that it’s unbearable. He tries to tell us “IF ONLY your cross was smaller, you’d be able to bear it and follow Jesus! You can’t follow Jesus with such a big cross.” The devil is a liar and his method is to deceive us into thinking that our cross is actually hindering our walking after Christ. He wants us to think that a life with difficulties makes it impossible to follow Christ. But in truth, the exact opposite is true! Goliath’s sword appeared once to be David’s biggest threat, but after a few short moments it turned out to be the very thing which he slew the enemy with. The cross once appeared to be the death of Jesus, and when God was finished with the work, it was the very thing that Jesus used to defeat death! In the Christian walk, our cross (including our trials and our temptations) many times seems to be the very thing that drives us into the ground burdening us and bringing us to despair, but if we trust in the Lord patiently bearing our cross - being faithful to obey without falling into discouragement, we will see that our cross will be the very thing which God uses to help us overcome many sins (which we never previously knew were in us) and to keep us in very close intimacy with Him.

When we look back on this life from eternity we will be thankful that God used the trials which we hated so much at the time to cleanse us of so much self-centeredness and love of the world. Godly people aren’t made in a one-night revival meeting, but through years of persistent cross carrying. This is God’s method. So when we are faced with it we must not have the immediate reaction to flee difficulty and take refuge in worldly comforts, but we must “count it all joy” because it’s the very thing which God is using to make us like Christ.

James 1:2-4  “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”

## Some Things I'Ve Learned About New Covenant Prophecy
*Oct 25, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=109)] 

![](images/109.jpg)

Below are some things I’ve learned as I’ve desired to practice the command to ‘prophesy’ in the new covenant, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14. When I first started attending with the small fellowship that would eventually become NCCF, we met in a home and we would take turns sharing what the Lord had been speaking to us personally. In this, we had a burden from the beginning to practice all that was written in 1 Corinthians 14, to build each other up in the Lord (Eph 4:16), and it set a good foundation for us in fellowship as we sought to practice it every week.

**1 Cor 14:39** *"Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy..."*

1. **Definition**– 1 Cor 14:3 - Prophesy speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation (encourage/strengthen/comfort (NLT)). This is the definition of new covenant prophesy. Heb 3:13 calls to encourage one another and lift them up in love. Focus on encouragement primarily first. The goal is to lift people up, pick up discouraged people – that is the best way to keep people from being hardened by sin as Hebrews 3:13 says. If we can learn to do that well, then the Lord can also speak words that will challenge/exhort/convict of sin at the right time too. Prophesy is better than the gift of speaking in tongues because it edifies others in the Church whereas speaking in tongues edifies only the one doing it (1 Cor 14:4).

2. **Prophesy is for everybody** – we can all aim to have and grow in the gift of prophesying. 1 Cor 14:31 - every person in the church can prophesy one by one. It’s not just for men, sisters can as well (1 Corinthians 11 says that when they do this, they must have their heads covered, which is to emphasize that God’s glory is what we want to stand out in the church, not man’s glory (1 Cor 11:7)).

3. **Keep it personal**– when preparing a word, keep it from personal experience and NOT THEORY. Jesus always spoke about only what He first practiced (Acts 1:1 talks of all that Jesus DID ['did' comes first] and then taught [taught comes second]). Beware of theory! Even if there is nothing new to share, it is better to repeat what you may have already shared than share something you haven’t experienced in your life. **The authority in Christ comes from a life that is lived in Him**. When studying the word of God, we need to study it for our own life and not merely in order to share something to others. Sometimes it helps me to keep a personal situation in mind and seek the Lord to speak on what He taught me through that, even if I don’t necessarily share the specific experience itself.

4. **Have a heart of humility** – do not share with self-confidence and preach AT people. I do not want to give others the impression I have everything figured out, but only prophesy according to the level of my faith (Rom 12:6). Let me always speak with a heart of humility, lifting Jesus up. John 12:32 – when Jesus is lifted up, that’s when others are drawn to Him (not when we ourselves are lifted up). I’ve said many wrong things in the past that I can remember, but the ones I regret the most that disgust me even to think about, are the ones I’ve shared with pride. Having failed in that area, it makes me often to pray beforehand that the Lord will help me have a heart of humility when speaking His Word.

5. **Put no confidence in the flesh** – Phil 3:3 *we are the true circumcision who put not confidence in the flesh*. If we lack the ability or confidence to speak publicly, let us not shrink back but seek the Lord to strengthen us. If we do have the natural ability to speak publicly let us not rely on it but always depend on the Lord to strengthen us, not on our own natural abilities. They key is faith and dependence on the Lord in both cases.

6. **Prepare and Pray** – Pray ahead of time, asking God to make it a rich time, asking for wisdom on what to share (James 1:5), and for the Holy Spirit to fill us as we speak, to speak with the right spirit and motives (Luke 11:13).

It’s also good to make it a practice to pray afterward as well, that any seed sown would fall on good ground and that folks would be blessed, and that the Lord would keep us from pride if others appreciate what we share, and that He would keep us from discouragement if nobody seemed to be blessed by what we share. What matters is if we spoke what the Lord wanted us to speak, and spoke it with humility. If we did that then He will have been blessed, and that’s what matters most.

7. **Spend time preparing** – In general, especially for those who have struggles speaking (staying organized, staying on time, staying on point, etc), it is good to write down what you would share to stay on point and to stay on time. Put in hard work beforehand, the Bible says we reap what we sow (Galatians 6:7). Proverbs 13:4 the soul of the diligent will be made fat. God rewards the hard work we put in. 1 Cor 14:40 – “*all things are done properly and in order*” – God desires order, so we must desire to speak clearly and orderly.

Also, we want to be presenting God’s Word in a way that people can receive it well and is engaging, just as a chef would work to prepare a meal so people can digest it easier (rather than putting all foods in a blender and giving them that). So we want to prepare for that too. But this does not mean that things always have to be a great new insight that we’ve seen. We should be willing to repeat something if the Lord wants us to. And even if what the Lord has laid on our hearts does not seem super exciting, if we are confident that we are sharing (to the best of our knowledge) what God wants us to share, we can be satisfied that we were in His will, and the Lord will be pleased.

8. **Keep it simple** – Jesus was so simple when He spoke – He was so practical and easy to understand. Sometimes the truth can be lost in someone’s intellect and oratory skills. We should speak in a manner that even a child can understand and get something out of it.

9. **Know when to stop**– Jesus did not drag on and on – The Sermon on mount was about 15 or 20 minutes if you read through it. God can deliver a good word in a short time! Speaking too long makes it harder for people to digest and loses their attention – it’s about *quality* and not *quantity*. Eccl 6:11 “The more words you speak, the less they mean. So what good are they?” (NLT) Only a few people have the ability to hold people's attention for an extended period of time. We have to be honest with ourselves, and it's better to speak shorter until the Lord gives us freedom to speak longer, than to speak too long and have people looking at their watches and losing interest, and then we have to be corrected by someone later (Luke 14:8-11).

10. **Do not fear or be timid but be bold** – 2 Tim 1:7 God has not given us a spirit of timidity/fear but of boldness. We can be bold not because of who we are but because of who He is, and what we've seen Him do in our own lives. God can take even our imperfections and use them. If we do the little we can, God will do what we can’t and bless the time. If we are simply faithful to fill the barrels with water, then the Lord will turn them to wine (John 2). This is where our confidence comes, we don’t have to have a false humility of “I’m not sure God can bless anyone through what I share.”

11. **Aim for Prophesy from the heart and not teaching from the head** – the Bible says anyone can prophesy (1 Cor 14:31) but not all can be teachers (1 Cor 12:29). Am I lifting up my brothers and sisters to walk closer to the Lord, or am I aiming to teach? Teaching is important, but few people are teachers, and unless God has clearly given someone that calling, we should be careful, because 1 Cor 8:1 says, *Knowledge makes us arrogant.* Knowledge if not handled in the right way can make us look down on others like the Pharisees. It’s not just *what* we are saying that is important, but *how* we are saying it (with what motive). A wrong motive in prophecy where it doesn’t have the good of others in mind may tend to focus on knowledge, doctrine, or other things that can stimulate the mind and are fun to think about. But the right motive is to desire to get under people and lift them up and challenge them, for their spiritual good.

12. **Eagerly seek the gift of prophesy out of love of others** – 1 Corinthians 13 – Do everything from love - The best act without love is worthless. 1 Cor 14:1 Love should be the highest goal – seek for the gift of prophesy out of love for the church, a desire to build others up to help them. This should be our motive always. “Two things a servant of God must have in their heart: 1. God’s Word, 2. God’s people” – Zac Poonen

13. **Prophesy often, even in personal conversations** – Prophecy does not only mean when one is speaking to the whole church at one time. For most people, it may primarily be in conversations with one or two others. Maybe it’s encouraging someone over a phone call or text message, or at someone’s home outside of Sunday – to a person’s spouse or children, etc. Encouragement is prophecy, and we can encourage people every day (Hebrews 3:13), which will help keep the people we love from being hardened by sin. If we want to bless others this is how we can do it, keeping our eyes open for opportunities. If we feel the Lord spoke to us something that will bless someone else, we can share it with them. But sometimes it may not be the right time to share (Prov 27:14), for example if my wife is asleep early in the morning it's better to let her finish her sleep first! But we can write it down so we don't forget and share it with the other person later - not only the right word but also giving it at the right *time* will bring the most blessing to someone else (Prov 15:23).

## Be Free From The Law, But Not From Self-Discipline
*Nov 16, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=111)] 

![](images/111.jpg)

INTRO

One thing that I always want to improve in and has at times been a struggle is to be more disciplined. In my own life I've seen that self-discipline helps me be more spiritually healthy, and sharp for the Lord. God has made it very plain even in nature, that the best results in anything come through consistency, not overnight. This is why it’s important to exercise self-discipline.

*“Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.” 1 Corinthians 9:25 NASB*

DEFINITION

Self discipline for a Christian means making a voluntary decision to do spiritually profitable things consistently, that we know will benefit *eternally.*

Many religions and even unbelievers try to discipline themselves, but the difference for us is our motive. THE MOTIVE

Self-discipline should be out of love and gratitude for the Lord – not out of compulsion because we feel we’ll be punished if we don’t do them.

*Colossians 2:23-3:1* *“These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.* *Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.”*

So it means setting goals for ourselves to spend our time and actions not just away from sin, but profitably (“All things are lawful, but not all are profitable” - 1 Cor 10:23) as best as we can for the sake of living for God, without condemnation or guilt if we sometimes fall short of meeting them.

If I am consistently undisciplined, years of my life can be wasted away eternally with little spiritual growth, even if the years were spent on lawful things which aren’t sin. I’ll pay an eternal price of spiritual growth, maturity, and closeness with the Lord.

BY FAITH

Self-discipline is by faith, because sometimes these activities may not ‘feel’ valuable at the time, or like they are doing much. We need to (by faith) make a decision by our will as to what is really eternally valuable, and exercise that decision consistently, even though we don’t always ‘feel’ the value of spiritual discipline in the moment. We do not see perfectly clearly yet (1 Cor 13:12), so if we only do what we 'feel' like all the time, only pursuing God when we are excited, then our life with Him will be very mediocre. We’ll hardly pray or meditate on His Word, and so we won’t grow much (1 Peter 2:2). I must “long for the pure milk of the word” (1 Peter 2:2), and that’s the way to growth. The sign of whether I’m longing for the pure milk of His Word is not do I have an intense desire to be seeking the Lord here and there, but if am I being consistent over a long period of time.

***Genuine longing for the Lord is marked by lasting consistency, not temporary excitement.***

THE SOUL OF THE DILIGENT IS MADE FAT

I believe that God has generally made it so that in the world, what a person seeks for, most of the time they will get it. Those in the world who labor the hardest for money and earthly success will in general gain what they are after. In a similar way, as Christians we can labor for spiritual gain, and if we are consistent and diligent we will succeed (except that unlike the world we have the 100% guarantee that we will succeed)

*"The soul of the diligent is made fat" - Proverbs 13:4*

I like how the Proverbs 13:4 says the “soul” of the diligent is made fat (not the “body” of the diligent) – so it’s not mainly talking about material things here! The person who pursues spiritual growth in Christ will be more fit to live for the Lord, just like a man who works trains physically would be more fit to fight in battle for his country. Many soldiers join the military because they want to serve and fight for the country who gave them freedom. They are so disciplined and diligent for their cause. Paul was a true disciplined soldier for the Lord, for the same reason, so “that he may please the one who enlisted him” (2 Tim 2:4).

PAUL’S EXAMPLE

The Apostle Paul starts 1 Corinthians 9 saying, "I am free" (1 Cor 9:1), and ends the very same chapter with the words “I want to discipline my body to make it a slave!” (1 Cor 9:27)! He's basically saying, "I'm free in the Lord, so I want to be His slave!"

I see so clearly here how Paul had a great freedom in the Lord, but he didn’t use it as most people would – to live for himself in relaxation and comfort. He was a zealous, studious Pharisee before being saved, but he didn’t ‘retire’ from being zealous and disciplined after coming to the Lord. Just like a grateful free resident becomes a solider to fight for his country, because of his gratitude and love for the Lord, Paul wanted to be fit to be used by God in return. If he saw himself like a knife for the Lord, he wanted to be the sharpest knife he could. And so he sought that very important quality that would help keep himself sharp: *self-discipline*.

AN EXTREME

We want to beware of burdensome extremes at the same time. Not everyone is as mature to be as disciplined as another person, so we don’t need to compare ourselves with others. Someone may say, “You spent your time playing sports when you could have been reading your Bible. You spent your money on that coffee when you could have given it for the Lord’s work.” This would be burdensome to think that God was a slave-driver who didn’t allow His employees breaks or refreshments. Even managers in the world allow employees breaks and provide them coffee for free! How much more does our good and perfect loving Father? God’s calling for our life is not burdensome (1 John 5:3). And Jesus enjoyed food, wine, and relaxing (Matt 11:19, Mark 6:31). He must be our definition and example to follow. Nevertheless, we want to make profitable decisions to set aside at least some of our time consistently to do what we KNOW to be eternally valuable.

WE REAP WHAT WE SOW

If we are spiritually strong today or spiritually weak today, it's not a coincidence - no more than a physically strong, or physically weak person is coincidentally weak or strong. A person who's been in the gym everyday for the past 2 years will be much stronger today than someone who's been sitting in front of the TV eating potato chips for 2 years. We are the result of our past decisions. *Galatians 6:7 "Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."* Paul said here “do not be deceived” because it’s a common deception to believe that we can reap by coincidence things we haven’t sown. Christ-likeness and spiritual growth are not automatic or coincidental. We will get out of the Christian life only what we put into it. Salvation is free, but spiritual growth is not! Like Paul, we enter into freedom and keep our freedom only by giving it up again – giving ourselves back to the Lord everyday.

There’s a poem:

*"The heights of great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight,*

*but they while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night."*

The greatest saints did not get there overnight, and they did not get there by coincidence. While others were ‘sleeping’ spiritually, they were toiling. And then one day people saw them and said “How did they get so high?!” It was in secret. They were reaping years of secret sowing.

START THE DAY WITH THE LORD

One discipline I’ll mention which I believe is very profitable is, I've noticed that when I am intentional to start the day drawing near to the Lord, I have a spiritual strength to face the day in a way I don't have if I don't connect with the Lord. I’ve heard some of my brothers share things that have greatly challenged me, like: “As the blind man reaches for his cane in the morning and can’t start the day without it, reach out to your Father right from the beginning of the day.” And "He who wins the morning wins the day." So I have a goal to draw near to the Lord everyday right from the start, and then “abide” with Him the whole day – staying connected with Him constantly (John 15). These actions starting out in the morning may be simply talking to God in bed, reading the Bible or a devotional, meditating on a Word in the shower, or something else. But the main thing is that 1. They have a goal of connecting with my Father, and 2. They are consistent.

*"The fruit of the Spirit is ... self control..." (Galatians 5:23)*


# Chapter Forty Four
## Don'T Eat From A Bad Tree, But Also Don'T Eat From No Tree
*Nov 29, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=112)] 

![](images/112.jpg)

There have been many times in the past when I've shared something that blessed me which I heard from someone (maybe this truth was from one of my elders I look up to, or a brother in the church, or someone in ministry), and I shared it with Christians whom I know, and the response I've heard back from them was, "You have to be careful. You should follow Jesus, not any man."

I respect the desire to be careful. There are constant exhortations in the New Testament to beware of false teachers. We must test everything with Scripture, no matter who it is that we're hearing it from (1 Thess 5:21). It's extremely dangerous to be listening to a false teacher - we should flee anyone who is not teaching according to the Bible, and also any teacher who is not *living* according to it!

**But there's another extreme in addition to following false teachers, which is just as dangerous, and even more prevalent. And that's to have NO teachers.**

In a sense, intentionally choosing to have no teachers may be even more dangerous than listening to false teachers, because the temptation for pride is there with thoughts like, "I follow the Lord alone, I don't need anyone, I can figure everything out myself". And it's a fearful thing to know that God Himself resists all proud people who don't want to listen to anybody:

*1 Peter 5:5 "Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for 'God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.'"*

Even Paul exhorted the Corinthians to follow him (1 Cor 11:1). It's an absolutely false humility to say we don't need anybody, when Scripture itself says that God gave apostles, prophets, and teachers to build us up (Eph 4:11-13). If someone falls into deception because of a false teacher - that false teacher will share in their guilt on the last day, and their blood will also be on his hands. But if someone is living in pride and won't listen to anybody, they will not become Christ-like, they'll continue in their sin, and their guilt is not shared with anybody - it's all their own!

Hosea 4:6 *"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge"*

Jesus said, "Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. (Matthew 7:15-17).

NOT ONLY did Jesus say, beware of bad trees which bear bad fruit, but He talked about good trees which bear good fruit! If the bad trees are false prophets and teachers then the good trees are godly prophets and teachers.

It's so sad that many Christians today miss out on good fruit because they think, "I'm not falling for any of these bad trees. I DON'T NEED ANY TREE." And since they don't want to submit to anybody, they don't get any good fruit. They starve because they refuse to eat *anything*. They remain spiritually stagnant year after year, with no connection with God, bitter, complaining, in slavery to bad attitudes, yelling at their spouses, looking down on others, absolutely empty of the joy of the Lord. This is because they didn't want to have godly authority in their life (Hebrews 13:17).

That kind of life is not God's will. If you want to bear good fruit in your life, beware of bad trees, but then go and find a good tree – godly people to listen and submit to who can help teach and lead you, who have proven their walk with God and borne fruit in their life, so that you can have the same outcome.

Hebrews 13:7 *"Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith"*

## Respect Your Spouse'S Hesitations
*Dec 30, 2018*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=114)] 

![](images/114.jpg)

Ephesians 5:21 *"Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ"*

Many husbands love to quote Ephesians 5:22 to their wives, which says "Wives, be subject to your husbands." Unfortunately probably most of those demanding husbands who quote that verse aren't also familiar with the verse before it (v21) - which says to "be subject to one another."

What does that practically mean to 'be subject to one another'? One way I've seen it in specifically in my home, in my own marriage, is that my wife and I must RESPECT EACH OTHER'S HESITATIONS. I believe that's one of the greatest lessons I've learned about real practical married Christian life. The reason why this is so important is because God guides us for decisions in our home through unity in marriage, and so if my wife has a hesitation in her spirit about some decision we have to take which affects our family, I see it as guidance coming directly from God through her.

'Be subject to one another' implies God's desire is for unity in Christ - it's like we're tied together by unseen bonds and the Lord is saying, 'Do not run off in one direction without your other half'. If I was physically attached to someone with chains and handcuffs, for example, I would not run off in a direction on my own because first of all, we'd go very slowly as I forcefully had to drag them along, and second of all, they would get hurt as they were dragged! It's best to make sure first that we are both clear on the direction we are going, and both ready to run that way.

So this means that as a husband, I should not just desire for my wife to let me have my own way all the time. If she has a hesitation about some decision I want to make that will affect our family, I should respect that, and be 'subject' to it. At the least, it should cause me to pause and consider, and seek the Lord for His will and for unity - she should agree with the direction that decision will take us. And if the freedom is not there, it should stop me altogether. There should not be any urgent 'rush' to jump into anything - I believe the devil many times tries to rush people into making decisions in order to force them outside of God's will. If something is so urgent that it can't wait, it's probably not of God! *"He who hurries his footsteps errs"* (Prov 19:2).

And from the other side, it also means, if I'm having hesitations, I should express them and we should wait on God until both of us are united, feeling freedom in our spirit - our goal is not only to be united with each other, but united with God (our wills both conformed to whatever His will ultimately is). And when the 3 are united (two spouses, and the Lord), then that will produce a rock-solid decision for our family - producing a strong cord that can't be broken by the devil (Eccl 4:12).

BOUNDARIES

So God speaks through unity, and if one of us is not 'all in' regarding a decision for the family, we should see that as a boundary the Lord has put there for us (Acts 17:26). God closes doors, and puts boundaries in our lives to keep us in His will, for our good and our protections. See what the Bible says may happen if we assert our strong will to force our way through a boundary He has set: Eccl 10:8 *"...a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall"* (we can take 'wall' to mean a hedge/boundary).

PERMISSION VS UNITY

Imagine I as a husband wanted to buy some car that was quite expensive, but felt the freedom to get it because we could purchase it without getting into debt (so there is no blatant sin there). But let's say my wife has a hesitation on my desired purchase even though we could afford it, and I say "Ok, I'll wait then" at first, but I'm not respecting her hesitation, so I continue on after that pestering her until she eventually says yes. I may be happy I got my way, but I would have missed God‘s best will because we didn’t have unity! I wouldn't have been obeying the word in Eph 5:21 to be 'subject to one another in the fear of Christ'. I wouldn't have been respecting her hesitations, I'd be dragging her along with me as I went forward with my own decision. There may not be sin committed, but we'll have missed God's best for our family - His highest good. The highest good in all areas of our life - family life, and even our walk with God - is not simply to get permission, it's to be united (with God first, and then with other disciples in Christ - the 3 stranded-cord).

Many times we seek simple permission and freedom so we can get what we want, because that's our primary burden. Our primary burden is selfish - it's to get what we want. "Can I do this? Ok great, thanks." Can you imagine our life with God like that? "Lord can I please spend all day playing video games? Are video games a sin? They're not? Ok great, thanks, I'll talk to you later in maybe 12 hours after I'm done playing all day." PERMISSION is not the highest good, UNITY is - where we are ONE in our desires and our highest goals. A real disciple will not walk according to permission, what they can 'get away with', but according to love and unity. "What is the best thing I can do for another?", not, "What is the best thing I can do for myself?"

John 17:22 *The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one*

If you find that you are pushing a desire of yours on your spouse, or the Lord, and you're finding resistance - stop and consider whether it may be best to simply die to that desire and let it go. This is the cross carrying life by which we can be fully connected (united) with the Lord and with other disciples. This is the path of discipleship.


# Chapter Forty Six
## Flying Higher In The New Covenant
*Feb 19, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=119)] 

![](images/119.jpg)

One burden which has stayed on my heart from what we’ve heard in the messages regarding the new covenant these past few weeks was from Matthew 11:11 – that it is absolutely critical to be living under the new covenant if I want to live at a higher level in the Christian life.

A HIGHER LEVEL

God's exhortation to us is "Come up hither" (Rev 4:1 KJV). He wants us to come up to a higher level. Why is that? It's because that's where He is! He is at the top of the mountain, and the higher we get up the mountain, the closer we are to the Lord. Every child of God is totally loved by Him, but not all are living at an equal level – some live like they are spiritually homeless still at the bottom of the mountain, while some few have pressed on and are living in spiritual riches, living in wonderful close fellowship with their Father and Savior.. experiencing 'Days like Heaven on earth.'

Matthew 11:11 *Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.*

John the Baptist lived at a very high level, the highest level possible (in the old covenant), but the level that someone in the kingdom of heaven lives (someone living under the new covenant, with all that God has provided to us after Jesus came) is higher than even John the Baptist!

I’m seeing clearer just how critical the new covenant is for us to have a deeper, victorious life with God. And it's not just the *doctrine* of the new covenant itself that is critical (we may learn the doctrines and still not be living the life), it's living life in the reality of the new covenant that is critical. No saint in the old covenant could attain to this level - not even John the Baptist.

My first thought in the past would have been, “Well look at how great John was, I would love to get to that level, what a godly saint he was!” But when I read something that the Bible says about him, it becomes so clear to see just how limited his level was:

JOHN THE BAPTIST
 Matthew 11:2-3 *Now when John, while imprisoned, heard of the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to Him [Jesus], “Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?”*

While John was in prison - he started doubting that Jesus was the Savior (after having already been revealed that by God - John 1:29-34). What does this mean for us that such a godly man had doubts in the Lord when he got sent to prison? Does it mean that we will also definitely fall into doubt in God if we get cast into prison? This is what happened to the greatest man in the old covenant. If I get thrown into prison I may also doubt my faith in God if I am living under the old covenant. I may have great faith one moment like David when he’s slaying giants, but then I may also fall into adultery and murder like David at another moment! I may have the patience of Job, but then I’ll also be subject to low periods of discouragement like him. May we all ascend to a life higher than the old covenant saints!

As great as the old covenant saints are, we can’t be content to live only at their level when God has opened up for us such a better life with Him in Christ than this. We *have* to enter into this new covenant that God established for us, where we know God as our Father personally, where we are looking to Jesus, carrying our cross in hope, and where we are filled with the Spirit and fighting our inward sins and getting victory by the power of His Spirit consistently, unlike how the old saints could fall quickly, experiencing great ups and downs. We have to see the line which the devil is trying to keep us shoved under – that line which keeps us from ascending higher than John, which keeps us from rising higher to meet the Lord, and we have to by God's grace rise above that line. What a pity that so many millions who love the Lord are still living under that line! The angels in Heaven must be shocked at how much we have available to us, but how little we gain of it.

THE NECESSITY
 And the devil is happy to keep multitudes of believers from ascending higher by blinding them to the truth of what God has enabled for us and given us in the new covenant, and also keeping many from ascending higher by convincing them that it’s not necessary or useful to ascend higher!

It is absolutely critical that we enter into new covenant life. But we will not, if we do not know God as our Father, and aren't filled with the Holy Spirit. We will live a mediocre Christian life, and perhaps we will still avoid Hell, but that’s not the main issue. Paul did not say “I consider everything rubbish so that I may avoid Hell”, he said “I consider everything rubbish so that I may gain Christ.” (Php 3:8) We may avoid Hell, but can still have massive eternal loss which we will regret forever (1 Cor 3:15).

THE FLESH RESISTANCE
 There's a major thought today that it's all too much, to aim for this level of inner life. "Let's focus on other things, it turns life with God into a chore to think about our sin too much, and striving too much, pressing into the Lord this hard." It's akin to saying, "Don't take your life with God TOO seriously, or you will ruin it." But I've seen that this is a temptation of my flesh - the flesh says, "That's too extreme, that's too radical. That level is not necessary." We may even be tempted to look down on others as "too serious" who are living at a higher standard and level than we are - what a deception that is. The greatest and clearest argument against that are the constant exhortations in Scripture itself to live with our all for the Lord. Here are just a few:

1 Cor 9:24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.

2 Timothy 2:4 No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.

Deut 4:29 "But from there you will seek'" the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.

Matthew 22:36-38 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And He said to him, " 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.' "This is the great and foremost commandment.

SERIOUSNESS/SOBERNESS
 If we really love the Lord, we will want to live at the highest level we can. If we're not aiming for that high level we have to be honest, maybe we don't love Him like we thought. On the last day when every person in history stands before God, I can't imagine Him ever saying to anyone, "You tried too hard to please me. You were too radical. You took me too seriously. You took my commands too seriously, and all those verses too seriously. You ran too hard."

I don't know how many years I have left to live, but I want to "consider them loss/rubbish" (Php 3:8) for the sake of knowing the Lord, living for Him, and giving my life fully to Him. If a rich man got sick with cancer and had a big hospital bill he had to pay, he could happily 'consider the hospital bill loss' because there's something much more important and valuable he paid for. He’d be happy to pay $1 billion to cure his cancer – it would be a bargain to him because of what he gained in return, which was his life back. I want to view my years here on earth like that, being totally happy to give them up in order to gain Christ.

We'll have trillions of years to live eternally with God without trials, without struggle with sin, enjoying the fullness of God and His great rewards in Heaven (the greatest being God Himself)… but we only have a few precious years here to gain them. May I never let them waste forever away, ending in eternal regret.

Millions are content to live a low level Christian life, similar to the level of old covenant saints. But the new covenant is now opened to us and we can fly much higher. It comes at a cost to our self-life, but it is absolutely worth it. "Great wings add weight to a bird, but they also add flight." The new covenant life of full discipleship and surrender to God looks heavy at first, but the level of our flight can be so much higher if we take the step into the new covenant with all our heart. May the Lord preserve a burden to live that higher level for the Lord, because He is also up there - the higher we are, the closer to Him we are!!

Ephesians 5:15 *Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, 5:16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil.*

## The Sin Of A Paralyzed Man
*Mar 11, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=124)] 

![](images/124.jpg)

A PARALYZED MAN
 In John 5 Jesus met a man who had been paralyzed for 38 years. This man often sat by the pool called Bethesda, because the Lord sent an angel there to stir up the waters and heal those who were in it (v4).

I wasn't surprised that Jesus healed this poor man. But I was a little surprised by what He told the man afterward:
*“'Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.'" John 5:14 NASB*

The thought entered my mind, what could this man have done who was paralyzed all his life which led Jesus to warn him so sternly "Don't sin anymore... lest something worse happen to you"? I pictured this man capable of little, except perhaps for begging for money. So I wondered, what was his great sin?

I believe the answer lies not outwardly, but what was within his heart, and we get a glimpse of this in verse 7:
*John 5:7 The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”*

I believe this verse shows an attitude within this man's heart which was one of "I'm the innocent victim. The reason why I have all my problems is because everyone else is selfish. They all won't help me into the pool, and they all cut in front of me when I try to get in myself."

He may have been paralyzed his whole life, but his sin nature and flesh was just as active as anybody else. His body couldn't harm anyone, but self-pity in his heart must have caused him to murmur and grumble and blame just like anybody else.

THE VICTIM VERSUS THE SINNER
 And so, his warning from the Lord is one which convicted me - if I have a view of myself as an innocent victim, and anybody else as "the problem", then the Lord has the same fearful warning for me - 'Sin no more (in your heart), lest something worse happen to you.' The only justified (innocent) ones are those who come to the Lord and say, "I'm the problem.. it's not my family or friends or children or spouse, or my coworkers - it's ME. I am the problem" (Luke 18:13-14).

It's tempting to hold grudges and blame when something bad has happened to us. Maybe it wasn’t someone else’s fault and I’m just looking to blame someone, or maybe it was someone else’s fault – maybe they sinned against me, maybe I have been a victim in that way - but I'm definitely not innocent either! And that means I cannot look down on anybody as if I’m better than them.

*Matthew 7:1 "Do not judge so that you will not be judged. 2 For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you."*

TRUE FAITH PRODUCES OBEDIENCE
 One thing I’ve seen in my own life is that when I don’t take a Scripture seriously, then I have to be honest... it must be because I don’t really believe it. I imagine a man who reads Matthew 7:1-2 for the first time, or Matthew 6:14-15 for the first time and takes it at its Word. If he really believes it, he says to himself, “Wow! If there’s even one person I don’t forgive while on here earth, then God won’t forgive me of my sins?! I have to go forgive my enemy right now!” That person would be absolutely radical to make sure that they’re not holding even one ounce against anybody else. If I continue to blame others or hold grudges it must be because I don’t believe what God says.

Praise God that He is absolute love, and His mercy is never-ending. He loves me as much as Jesus (John 17:23)! And it was out of absolute love that Jesus gave such a fearful word to the paralyzed man. It's like this paralyzed man was driving a car straight off a cliff, and Jesus told him sternly, “You’d better turn your wheel the other direction right now, you’re heading for a cliff.” Praise God for His Words to us now, so that we can avoid the cliff of judging and blaming others.

Lord, help me to release any grudge, or unforgiveness or judging I have against every single person on earth, and reject every thought that "I'm the innocent one."


# Chapter Forty Eight
## Be The Punching Bag
*May 5, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=127)] 

![](images/127.jpg)

1 Peter 2:23 *"While being reviled, He [Jesus] did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously;"*

THE PUNCHING BAG

Professional boxers spend years everyday hitting a punching bag. All that bag does is absorb punches. It's made to take a hit - thousands upon thousands of hits without ever hitting back even once! I remember some years ago the Lord encouraged me during a time where I was experiencing unusual persecution from others. The Lord gave me a word which really lifted me up: He said to me, "Be the punching bag." In other words, "Let others hit you, and you stay quiet - absorb the blows without returning evil for evil; and this will be beautiful to Me." The word in the midst of that experience changed my life, and it showed me an aspect of the beauty of Jesus that I'd never seen to that depth before.

"Be the punching bag" - In other words - if we are experiencing persecution, receive the blows as our Lord did - hit after hit, blow after blow (just like a punching bag) without reviling in return, and then we can praise God that we have the privilege of partaking in Christ's suffering because He was a punching bag for us first (verse 24).

WINNING AN ARGUMENT, LOSING A LOVED ONE

When we are in an argument with someone, it’s tempting while they are speaking harshly with us to start preparing (in our mind) so we can 'hit back' very hard with harsh words of our own after they're done speaking. "I will fire back and put them in their place, so they will be ashamed and have no response." It's like we're standing there slowly loading our gun of harsh words, one at a time like bullets into the barrel, and then when they stop speaking it’s our turn to fire away! Attitudes like this may win arguments, but they lose relationships. A brother like this may win an argument, but will lose a brother. A husband like this may win all the arguments, but will lose his wife.

This is what the world does, not a child of God. People who act like this are acting very similar to demons - they want to see other people hurt. No being in heaven wants to see someone hurt, never did an angel want to see someone hurt. But man can go to a level lower than even an animal. An animal kills another animal to get food. But demons exist to get pleasure out of pulling down people, they want to drag men to Hell with them where they themselves are going. And when we aim to pierce someone with harsh words and we are trying to tear them down in return, we are doing the same thing as the demons! *"Blessed are the peacemakers, they are the sons of God."* (Matthew 5:9)

Jesus was once with His disciples, who (after having people reject their ministry) asked the Lord, "Do you want us to call down fire on them to destroy them?! (Luke 9:54)" Our Lord replied, "You have no idea what kind of spirit you're of (v 55)." It definitely wasn't God's Spirit that they were in fellowship with at that moment. Children of God are like punching bags - they are willing to continually take hits (insults and rejection) and remain quiet without retaliating for the sake of peace.

THE MIGHTIEST PEOPLE ON EARTH

Proverbs 16:32 *"He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city."*

A punching bag may look weak (receiving hit after hit), but it's actually very strong. It has to be in order to receive thousands of hits and remain unharmed. Someone who rules their inner spirit, their anger, and their tongue is very, very strong - mightier than every mighty man on earth! Very few people on earth are a king of a country, or are able to say that they’ve traveled to space, or that they are billionaires, for example. These belong to a very select group of people; some rare ones on earth. But there’s another very select and rare group, much greater than these - and that’s those who can rule their spirit. And they are greater than any select group of mighty men on earth! Samson could kill 1000 people, but what use was that when he couldn't rule the lusts within himself? His inner weakness was his end. One overcomer in Christ is greater than 1000 Samsons. There are many types of trials in life, but usually the most intense and the hardest involve other people who are sinning against us. I want to be in the rare group of people who by God's power can rule over my inner spirit in the midsts of these most difficult trials, and have complete control of my tongue and the fiery anger which most in the world are slaves to their whole life.

DON'T LOSE THE JOY

There's something better than freedom from anger in the midst of persecution, though. Emptiness of evil is good, but fullness of the Lord is better! In addition to freedom from inner turmoil, we also want to be filled with joy and peace, praising the Lord in our spirit, even in the midst of persecution. Psalm 37:1 says, *"Do not fret because of evil doers"*and then it goes on to say *"Delight yourself in the Lord"* (v4).Is someone doing a lot of evil towards you? Don’t fret! And then additionally, be totally careful not to lose the joy of the Lord no matter what. We lose the joy of the Lord so easily and too easily put up with it. Sometimes in really hard trials I've experienced, that’s what the Lord has spoken to me: "Right now it's critical: don’t lose the joy of the Lord. This is how you can stand." We often take the command so flippantly to rejoice in the Lord always (Philippians 4:4), and so easily let somebody else steal our joy. We have to fight for it. The Bible says we have to "Be diligent to enter God's rest" (Hebrews 4:11).

Joy and peace don't come by coincidence. We don’t get joy and rest in the Christian life by keeping a laid-back attitude, we have to diligently fight just like the Israelites did to enter into rest. The moment we decide to sit down and "wait it out" - wait for the trial to pass, wait for the joy to come.. then we've already lost the battle. We have to actively fight the enemies of sin inside ourselves and discouragement and guilt and whatever else is defeating us. How do we do that? It's not to bury ourselves in a bucket of ice cream, or distract ourselves with entertainment, or listen to nice emotional music like King Saul - these false comforts only makes things worse in the long run. Our sword in this fight is God’s Word, and His promises (Ephesians 6:17, 2 Pet 1:3-4). Is somebody at work angry with you? Well God is not! (Romans 5:9). Is somebody frowning at you? Well God is not, He's dancing over you! (Zephaniah 3:17). Is somebody threatening you? Well God is not! He has promised you a future and a hope! (Jeremiah 29:11). Is somebody not talking to you? Well God is! He said cry out to me in the day of trouble and I will answer you! (Psalm 50:15, Psalm 91:15). There's an answer in God's Word for every single attack on our joy and rest in the Lord, and every temptation to despair or take revenge in anger.

EXPECTATIONS

Another last thing is: don’t **expect** people to treat you right. We set ourselves up for failure if we place expectations on people.

Psalm 118:8 *“It is better to take refuge in the LORD Than to trust in man.”*

A man who can’t be happy unless people are acting how he wants or doing what he wants them to do is a man that will never have joy.

This is why the Bible doesn’t just say “Rejoice always”, it says, “Rejoice **in the Lord** always.” It has to be IN THE LORD alone, not when other people are treating us right.

We should be assuming people will treat us wrongly, sin toward us, neglect us, and be inconsiderate. I believe this is what Jesus meant when He said, "Do people treat a servant any better than their master? If they persecuted Me, they'll persecute you. (John 15:20)" I used to think this verse applied just to persecution for our faith in Jesus, but I believe we can apply it to regular living too (such as a very mean manager at work, or someone intentionally left work for you to do which they should have done, or a selfish driver on the road, or your relatives are sternly criticizing you because of how you are raising your kids) - because Satan is often trying to persecute us *through* other people to get us to sin. He desires with all his might to make us sin, and he will use any means necessary (including other people) to do it. And if we repay evil with evil - then the devil has been doubly rewarded! Not only did he succeed in causing this other person to do evil, but he succeeded in causing us to do evil! This has been a great motivator to me to repay evil with good - to remember WHO exactly is behind the persecution. **If we repay evil for evil, we are actually *rewarding* Satan for persecuting us.** When I saw that I said, "Wow! That's terrible. I never want to repay evil for evil ever again." So we will do well to think of it as a bonus if somebody treats us right, but not to expect it. Instead - BE the punching bag - absorb the blows with all humility, saying "I am nothing, so I deserve nothing and I will expect nothing from anyone else - may You receive glory, Lord, from me remaining quiet. May you see this as beautiful. May it be a sweet smelling aroma to You."


# Chapter Forty Nine
## Stop Working For Your Salvation
*Jul 26, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=130)] 

![](images/130.jpg)

About 15 years ago I attended a Bible study, and at the beginning of each study, an ice-breaker question was asked. One week the question was something to the effect of: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you enjoy life?” People went around the room giving different answers, a lot of people said different things – numbers like 6, 7, 8. But there was one young man there who said, “I’d say a 10.” The interesting thing was that this was a young single man who had one of the hardest lives I’d seen – he had no immediate family (he lost both his parents at a young age, and had no siblings), was supporting himself from the age of 16, with a low-paying job renting a room somewhere, driving a very cheap junker of a car. He didn’t have that much Bible knowledge and he was a pretty new Christian - but the interesting thing is, here he was - the happiest out of the whole group of us!

And there were a few things I felt the Lord speak to my heart about his example, as I meditated on this young man’s happiness. One thing that stayed on my heart was this: this young man did not seem weighed down with religion and trying to earn his salvation. He freely enjoyed God‘s love and forgiveness, and carried no condemnation for himself. He didn’t carry along guilt like so many of the rest of us do, he wasn’t trying to work for his salvation. He wasn’t the most knowledgeable or mature one in the group, but he didn’t need to be! A believer on day 1 can have as much security and joy and rest in the Lord’s love and His work, as the most mature one who’s walked with God for decades (the sad thing is if we’ve walked with God like that for a while, but then start going back into being grounded on our own works – like the Galatians did in Galatians 3:3). There was a genuine innocence about this young man that didn’t constantly have the struggle that I’ve so often personally had myself - of trying to please God and falling short, and then entering into feeling guilty and discouraged.

That’s the sense I got from this young man – a rest in God’s work. He reminded me of, “Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest” (Matt 11:28). Maybe some of it was his natural personality, I’m not sure, but I believe the truth is there - that I should live with the same freedom that I think I saw in him. And I believe it’s not very different from what Jesus meant when He said that we have to come to God like a little child (Matthew 18:3). A little child is just someone who receives what a parent gives (since they know they are incapable themselves) – a ‘taker’. That’s what a Christian is too - just a ‘taker’ of what God freely gives. That’s how we were saved, and that’s how we progress in the Christian life. It’s ***exactly*** like the story of the prodigal son (Luke 15) - we recognize we are empty, that the Lord loves us, we ask the Lord to give, and then simply take what He gives (the ‘taking’ is faith).

Ephesians 2:8-9 *"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."*

I'm so happy to just be a taker, it's very restful. There will never be anything to boast of whatsoever on my part, I'm just a receiver of God's mercy that was poured out. Praise God!

No more working for my salvation, no more doubting my salvation because of my failures. It’s like the verse says: “Cease striving and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10). Cease striving - GOD LOVES YOU. Be like this ‘young one’ who has a full confidence and assurance in what God has done for you, and resting in that. We will freely leap into eternity clinging onto Jesus’ feet! Not our own works.

We can have a ’10 out of 10’ happiness in the Lord too if we have that rest and assurance in His love and our eternal life with Him, and that’s His will for us to have:

1 John 5:13 *These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.*

When we start our life with God on this foundation - of security in His unconditional love for us which saves us forever in Jesus, then we will start building on top of that foundation - Christ-likness, and bearing fruit of godly character - both inside and out. And that's the proof that the foundation was real all along ("Faith without works is dead" (James 2:17)). I've found that as we grow in the Lord that He increases our burden to build on top of the foundation over time, to be more devoted to the Lord, to hate and fight sin more, to carry our cross, to build up others for the same. It doesn't come overnight. But the Lord gave me freedom from fear over losing my salvation because I know that God loves me, is patient me, and when He looks at my righteousness, He doesn't see mine, He sees Jesus' now. And as long as I don't leave Him by turning back to my old ways, then He won't leave me. John 6:37 *"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out."*

## Two Cliffs: Worldliness And Religiosity (Part 1 Of 2)
*Sep 17, 2019*

*(Two Cliffs – Part 1 of 2)**[(See Part 2 of 2 here)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=137)*

Matthew 7:13-14 *"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.”*

Jesus said the only way that leads to life is a very narrow path. I don't believe that narrow path which Jesus talked about has fences on both sides which keep us from going off the path. I believe instead, I should see it as having a cliff on each side. And just like if we were walking across a narrow bridge with no railing and would be careful to stay exactly in the center of it, if we are wise we always want to remain in the absolute center of God’s will all the time. The further we carelessly allow ourselves to drift away from the Lord and the center of His will, the more dangerous it is.

The Lord has warned me personally of two cliffs on each side of the narrow path that are extremes which can be temptations to fall into – the first is worldliness (being so careless toward God, and caught up with the things of the world), and the other is religiosity (being so caught up and serious about religion itself – the laws, outward practices, good works, rules, doctrines, etc - and forgetting about God Himself and real Christian love). They are like two extremes on opposite sides of the narrow path, but both can lose God and ultimately fall away from Him if they are continued on an unrepented of.

CLIFF 1: WORLDLINESS

James 4:4 *“Whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.”*

Regarding the first cliff of worldliness, let’s take the example of a man named Demas who traveled around with the apostle Paul and served the Lord with him. (What follows is an embellished story of an actual person in the Bible, for sake of illustration – Phm 1:24, Col 4:14, 2 Tim 4:10). Demas followed Paul faithfully for a very long time. He saw him preach day and night, going to visit people in their homes, going to synagogues, seeing Paul painfully enduring harsh circumstances and harsh treatment for the sake of Christ. Demas doesn’t receive the same persecution, but he sees Paul's great sacrifice, and so the life of Paul impresses him and challenges him. But one time in their travels, him and Paul were lacking some money, and he encouraged Paul to go ask the church for some money. Paul said, "No, I trust God to provide for our needs, I refuse to be a burden on them and want to set an example." And so for the next week Paul stayed up late every night sewing pieces of cloth together into a large tent so he could sell it (trusting God and working hard are not contradictory!) Paul had to cut back on food that week to make ends meet, he didn’t ask Demas for any help, and he was still preaching and exhorting the church often both in the days into the night. Nobody else in the fellowship knew what was going on with their financial lack besides Demas.

At the end of the week Paul sold his tent and made enough money so he could support himself and Demas the rest of the month, and they didn’t have to ask the church for even one cent! They could continue on. Demas criticized him saying, "We should’ve just asked the church for some money. Didn’t you yourself say that a laborer is worthy of his wages? We’ve hardly had any food or even a decent place to sleep. If you insist on not taking money from the churches, we should at least work to store up a big savings so this doesn’t happen again."

And Paul replied to Demas, "I do all things for sake of the gospel. But you’d better be careful Demas, to strive to enter in through the narrow gate - that you consider God Himself the only thing you really need in this life, that you’ve surrendered everything else in your heart. You will be wise to seek the Lord for full freedom from the love of the world, because we know that many after chasing after that have pierced themselves with many griefs and even left the Lord all together (1 Tim 6:10). Be careful."

Fast-forward a few years later. For Demas, one thing led to another. Those subtle indicators of love of the world slowly turned into what Paul had foreseen. Demas disregarded Paul's voice, and his love for the world only grew from there, one instance at a time. He inched closer and closer to the edge of the cliff. Eventually, one day an opportunity came up for Demas to join a band of dishonest traders who traveled around selling mediocre merchandise and making a large profit... and they were very good at it. So he decided to join them. After a little bit of an inward struggle and feeling the tug of the temptation for the world which he had not been fighting up to this point, he left Paul, then soon left the Lord altogether. Demas never fought or hated his inward love for the world, so it grew and grew as his love for the Lord only shrunk… until eventually his love for the world outweighed his love for God, which dwindled to nothing. Demas gained the world but ultimately lost his own soul.

*"Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me"* - Paul (2 Timothy 4:10)

That’s cliff number one: the cliff of worldliness. Demas fell off the narrow path and lost Jesus. If we don't want to fall off of that cliff, we have to seek to be fully free from the love of this world. Because if we allow the idols in our heart to remain, they will grow and eventually they can shipwreck our faith altogether. I've seen desires for 'other' things outside of God grow, and it has choked my spiritual life every time (Mark 4:19). I've had to repent from that many times and tell the Lord again that I want Him to be the only thing important to me. I've seen how we have to seek everyday to be 'All in' for the Lord – to continue to tell ourselves, He is the only thing that really matters in this life. The standard we have to aim for (even though we are not there yet) on this narrow path is: in our own hearts to count everything outside of Christ as worthless (Php 3:8). If we are aiming for that, then we will get closer and closer to walking completely in the middle of that narrow path where the Lord is everything, and everything else is nothing to us. This is God’s highest and best will for us. The safest and happiest place in all of the universe is in the very center of God’s will.

Luke 14:33 (TLB) *"No one can become my disciple unless he first sits down and counts his blessings—and then renounces them all for me."*

CLIFF 2: LEGALISM AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE

*(Two Cliffs – continued – Part 2 of 2) [(See Part 1 of 2 here)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=136)*

Here is another story (also embellished for the sake of the illustration) of a real person in the Bible:

Mr. Simon the Pharisee (Luke 7:36-50) was a faithful fellow - his whole life praying for the Messiah to come. He was very disciplined. People used to ask him, "How is it that you’re able to get up at the same time every morning and pray?" (Back in those days they didn’t have alarm clocks). He would say, "I’ve trained myself well, I’ve never missed a day since I was 12." He was very strict, and for this people admired him. He knew the Scriptures inside and out, and often quoted Scripture in casual conversations. This was not to build others up but because he felt that all conversations should be related to religious matters and that any conversation that wasn’t like that was a waste of time. Because of this he very rarely talked to new converts or children, except to correct them.

Simon one day met a man he thought may be a prophet, whose name was Jesus. He had hope that maybe this really could be an actual prophet (Israel hadn’t had one in 400 years!) and possibly even more… maybe even the Messiah! And so he listened and watched Jesus carefully to try to figure out if this was indeed the one Israel was waiting for. After observing Jesus for a while, he saw the power in Jesus’ life, the authority with which He spoke, the great miracles He could do, and Simon’s confidence and excitement was growing. Some of his other Pharisee friends were skeptical, but Simon the Pharisee started to admire Jesus (though not fully believing Him yet) - and so one day he invited Jesus over to his house for dinner, along with his Pharisee friends and others who were following Jesus around to listen to Him.

While they were there in Simon’s home relaxing and talking at the table, one woman who heard that Jesus was at Simon’s home (this woman was widely known as previously being a prostitute) suddenly came into the house with a jar, approached Jesus from behind as He was reclining at the table, and went straight to His feet to start washing his feet with perfume that was in the jar (that she no doubt bought with the money she previously received from her prostitution). She couldn’t stop weeping as she wiped his feet with her hair and her tears. Simon had an intense inner fury within himself, thinking, "How can Jesus let this happen? He should be telling her to leave, he must not know who she is. If he won’t tell her to leave, maybe I should. God’s law says this woman should have been stoned already!"

These thoughts were bugging his heart (as legalistic rules and thoughts often do, since a religious mind is consumed with what other people are doing wrong instead of the sin its own heart). To Simon’s surprise, Jesus then defended the woman and told him that people who are forgiven for more, love more. And that because of all of her sin (and her recognition of God’s immense mercy and forgiveness after she repented), she was the one showing the most love toward Him and God, even above him and his Pharisee friends! This rebuke offended Simon, and this action by Jesus of such blatant disregard for the rules in God’s Word convinced Simon that Jesus was neither a prophet, nor the Messiah. That was the last time Jesus had dinner at Simon’s house.

I’m not sure if Simon the Pharisee changed his ways and repented of such religiosity and legalism, but if he didn’t, then he would have lost Jesus forever because he worshiped religion instead of God. Why would he do that? Many people worship religion like that, and become very religious. I believe it's so that they can get the benefits of following God (peace in their own conscience, and eternal hope), without really giving up their self-life. They want to give God the minimum they can, while still getting all that He offers.

For the religious, if they can follow a set of rules well, and do enough good works, if their good deeds outweigh their bad ones, then they’ve deceived themselves that they are now justified before God. Honest people, such as Paul, though, will have to confess that the best of their righteousness still falls short (Romans 7:7), and then there is hope for them because then they can see their utter need for God - that was God's purpose for the entire old covenant law (Gal 3:22). But the religious people who are not honest with themselves and hate the truth about themselves, go on to be deceived thinking they are right with God (2 Thess 2:10) and continue live for the most part in wickedness as they’d like *(especially inwardly - in their thoughts and attitudes)* as long as they follow some outward rules strictly and do enough outward works of service for God. And then along with it comes, pride, and judging/looking down other people who don’t keep all these same rules, or don't outwardly do as much as them. I think this is what happened to Simon the Pharisee.

So, someone who loves religion like this (and ultimately themselves) instead of God/Jesus and other people will fall off of Cliff number two - the cliff of religiosity and spiritual pride. And the thing about this cliff that's so dangerous is that most who fall off of it don’t even know they’ve fallen off! They can believe until the end of their life that they have pleased the Lord very well. There will be a lot of shocked people standing before the Lord on the last day (Matt 7:22), and I don't want to be one of them. I believe that in serious churches, the bigger danger is falling off of cliff number two - the rules, pride and legalism cliff. Looking down on others, feeling that we are pretty good because we kept rules and did good works. To claim to love Jesus, but to despise people He has accepted that don’t have the same convictions about the rules that we do. To push our convictions on other people. To take satisfaction in our amount of truth and Bible knowledge we have or spiritual activity we've done compared to other people. May the Lord fill me with His Spirit to have genuine love inside of me (Romans 5:5), not religiosity!

I don't want to just bounce around going down the narrow path, like a driver on the road who's not paying attention. I want to remain in the very center of the narrow path that leads to life. May the Lord keep me absolute-center in His will on the narrow path. We aren’t perfect, but if we sincerely seek the Lord for help to stay in the center of His will our whole life, at the cost of our self-life, then He will preserve us from falling into the two extremes which can ultimately shipwreck our faith - worldliness and religion.

Philippians 2:12-13 *"work out your salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."*


# Chapter Fifty Two
## Choking The Desire For God
*Dec 4, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=12)] 

![](images/12.jpg)

*2Tim 2:4 “No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.”*

The Bible compares the Christian life to many things. It compares it to a man who sells everything he has to buy a single pearl (Matt 13:4), to being an athlete who runs his race with diligence (1 Corinthians 9:24), and to a soldier who is enlisted for battle (2 Tim 2:4). The Bible uses extreme examples to illustrate that like these people, a Christian should have a single-minded goal in life - and that is to please God.

A Christian who has a worldly heart is like a soldier who is in a foreign land and starts to become busy and caught up with all of the attractions of that new land. He quickly loses sight of his goal and his duty, and pretty soon he’s made his home in that foreign land because he’s captivated by all it can offer. His mind is constantly occupied by these new things and he has forgotten about the war he came into the land to fight. It didn’t happen all at once but very slowly it happened without him even realizing it because he was following the subtle desires of his flesh and lost sight of his higher calling. The same thing happens to many believers.

*Mark 4:19 “But the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.”*

The subtle pleasures and cares of life can creep in, at first very harmlessly. But then over time they start to grow. It’s like a little flat balloon that the devil slips into my heart. He will deceive me by saying that it’s just a small insignificant deflated balloon that doesn’t take up much space, that there’s plenty of room for it. But once it is in my heart (where I cannot exercise my will anymore to say no to it consistently), the devil will then slowly inflate it over time, little by little. Then, over time, it will crowd out my affection for God. The previously flat balloon in my heart that’s filled with worldly cares grows, and the other balloon in my heart which is filled with the desire for God gets squished by it, and becomes smaller.

This verse (Mark 4:19) explains much about why it’s often hard to follow God with consistent whole-heartedness. Why do we sometimes lose our desire for God and our desire to please Him? Because desire for enjoyments and the things of the world creep into our heart and ‘choke’ and ‘suffocate’ the word. Our heart only has so much room in it, and if it is crowded up with desires for the world then our desire for God will suffocate. If we fill our stomachs with junk-food, we will have no desire for healthy food. We may not outwardly reject God, but our Christian life will be unfruitful and useless for God’s purposes. We will slowly drift from Him and make no spiritual progress. We will lose our closeness with God and a consequence of this is that we will also lose our peace in the Lord and become disturbed more and more by the troubles of the world. God might have to allow us to see that we cannot find rest in the things of the world in order that we will come back to Him for rest, just like the prodigal son went back to his father only after the world let him down.

Since Jesus said that a desire for “other” things can choke the word, we should understand that the “other” things He was talking about aren’t necessarily sinful things. We can refrain from sin, but still live to please ourselves (in things that aren’t sinful) and in that way choke the word out of our lives.

*1 Corinthians 10:23 “All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.”*

There is a type of Christian who is content to be saved from Hell, but then desires to spend the rest of his or her life not living for God, but instead doing many ‘lawful’ yet ‘unprofitable’ things. They are comfortable with themselves as long as they are not committing any major sin, and apart from that, they can enjoy as much of the world as they want. They want to have Heaven for themselves when they die, but they also want to have the “heaven” that this earth has to offer too!

This is not the type of heart that loves God. If we really love God we will not primarily look to gain pleasure for ourselves, but we will strive to live our lives to please God. As our verse in 2 Tim 2:4 says, a solider does not entangle himself in everyday life, because he wishes to please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. If we love God, we won’t live for our own pleasure. Our goal will be to please God above ourselves.

There’s a picture of this in the Old Testament. In Israel, the most sacred spot in the whole world was called the ‘Holy of Holies’. This was in the tabernacle and later in the temple, and it represented where God dwelt. It was so sacred that only the high priest could go in once a year (Heb 9:7), and God gave specific commands of what was to be placed in there. Nothing and nobody could go in there that didn’t belong.

In the New Covenant, each of our bodies are called the temple of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy of Holies is now each of our hearts. So just like in the Old Covenant, nothing should enter my heart that doesn’t belong because my heart is the place that should be totally occupied with God. Your and my heart is the sacred place that belong to God and we shouldn’t crowd them with pointless worldly things. We must treat our hearts with sacred reverence:

*Prov 4:23 “Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it flow the springs of life.”*

To “watch over your heart with all diligence” means to be careful what you set your primary desires after. It’s not sin to enjoy the blessings that God has given us. The Bible says that God has given us many of these things for our enjoyment (1 Tim 6:17). We can freely enjoy things of this world which aren’t sin. But we should never let an enjoyment or interest in certain things of the world become an obsession, where our hearts are entangled in them and we start to chase after them. Our strongest desire in life should be to please God because we love Him. So be very careful when your desires start to stray away from God. When this happens, repent immediately and determine yourself by the grace of God to press into the Lord whole-heartedly again. Strive to please God, spend less energy on other things and trust God to let them fall into place where He allows them to:

*Matthew 6:33 “Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”*


# Chapter Fifty Three
## The Master Encourager Says: Hold Fast
*Dec 21, 2019*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=146)] 

![](images/146.jpg)

FASTING/HOLDING FAST

Some time ago I wanted to do a search in the Epistles (New Testament letters) to see all the times it talked about fasting (from food). So I opened up my Bible program and searched for the word ‘Fast’ to see all the times it came up – what are all the things God said to the first disciples in the new covenant about fasting?

What I saw in the search results on the word “Fast” turned up a big surprise for me.

In the epistles, the New Testament letters to the early disciples, I didn’t find any instructions about fasting from food, how to do it, when to do it, etc – but it turned up a whole lot of results on two phrases (that basically mean the same thing) that contained the word “Fast”: “be steadfast”, and “hold fast”!

Wow! To me this was a revelation – that God’s emphasis to persevere (hold fast) is so critical. That’s what He was emphasizing to the early disciples. And it was like God directly speaking to me too – what did He want me to *emphasize* on. It wasn’t ‘fasting logistics’, but ‘holding fast’ to what I have!

EMPHASIS

A parent will emphasize the most important things the most. For example, he or she will teach a child both to respect adults, and also to tuck in his bed in the morning. Both are good things, but one is a lot more important than the other. Respecting adults should be talked about a lot more than tucking in sheets! And correction of a disobedience there should be dealt with a lot more sternly than if a child doesn’t tuck in his bed sheets.

I’ve seen that in the same way, I don’t only need good Bible knowledge, I need to know what God’s emphasis is for me, what does He want me to prioritize and focus on over other things. It’s not just knowledge, but *wisdom*. And I believe I can see what God’s emphasis for me is by how much He talks about something in His Word. God did not write the Scriptures through men aimlessly, random wandering thoughts. The One who knows the exact number of hairs on my head (Luke 12:7) knew exactly how many times each word and phrase would come up in all of the Bible! It wasn’t by coincidence that the Lord mentions “Hold fast” and “Be steadfast” over and over again across the epistles.

And Jesus actually used the phrase first, a long time before the rest of the New Testament was written:

Jesus said, Luke 8:15 *"But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and **hold it fast**, and bear fruit with perseverance."*

Jesus was the first one Who talked about it when He said that the Christians who bear fruit are the ones who hear the word, **hold it fast**, and bear fruit with **perseverance**.

If I were to paraphrase it, I think we can say it plainly: the way to bear fruit (to become like Jesus and walk with God) is to hear God’s Word, and then to keep on obeying it, day after day, every day, for the rest of our life, however long we may live on this earth. As long as today is still called ‘Today”!

ENCOURAGEMENT

In our church we’ve often quoted Hebrews 3:13, emphasizing encouraging one another, which is our protection from becoming hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Hebrews 3:13 “But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.”

But what is the verse after it?

Hebrews 3:14 *“For we have become partakers of Christ, if we **hold fast** the beginning of our assurance firm until the end”*

To me, this tells me one of the best ways to encourage myself and someone else, and be protected from sin: the exhortation must be emphasized to ‘hold fast’, to be steadfast, to persevere everyday, to not give up, to take one step at a time.

I remember our Brother Sandeep shared years ago – the coach of a marathon runner doesn’t yell to the runner, “PUSH IT!” he says: “One step at a time.”

The fact that fasting (from food) shows up so little in the Bible, and “holding fast” does show up frequently speaks to me that the Master Encourager wants to cheer me on in my marathon – and He’s not focusing on telling me about little details of my running form (though they’re important and He will speak them to me at the right time here and there). He’s mostly saying ‘Hold fast’ – don’t get overwhelmed by the length of the run. Have endurance by making up your mind that you won’t give up, and then after that just take the next step. I've noticed even in matters of earthly endurance (like running a long distance) that the encouragement that helps me the most is - commit to finishing. As long as I'm able, I'll keep running until I reach the end, no matter how many times I stumble along the way. I will by the grace of God, go all the way.

And this word has been one of the most critical in my whole life, and kept me getting up after falling, kept me pressing on when I was tired: hold fast. It’s been one of the words from God to me that’s helped me most. Get up after falling (1 Jn 1:9). Press on through the hard day. Keep resisting in the temptation (Jas 4:7). Continue to confess and believe God’s promises and think about the hope I have when things look grim (Heb 6:19 – steadfast hope). Keep focusing on the joy before me when the cross is the most painful (Heb 12:2). When the load seems too hard to bear, keep taking it to the Lord in prayer, and be thankful (Php 4:6-7). Constantly repent of any coldness of heart toward God, be on fire again (Rev 2:4-5, 3:16-19). I know all these things already, now I have to set my mind that I’ll keep doing them the best I can until my dying day.

A COMMITMENT

Because my life is His now, I’m never taking it back for myself. I give myself to the Lord not by becoming a missionary or evangelist, but by committing myself to Him forever. A woman doesn't give herself over to a man by working for his company. She gives herself over to him by marrying him - a lifelong commitment. Or it’s like a person who has voluntarily traded themselves in happily to a Master, to be their slave forever. One who sells himself into slavery is permanently saying to the One he sells himself to, “I’m yours.” He has no intention of obeying himself sometimes, and then his Master at other times.

But sometimes we do slip up and obey ourselves.

Praise God that it’s not primarily our perseverance that’s our hope that keeps us, it’s His!

Hebrews 13:5 *“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,"*

If we don’t give up on God (who’s not just a Master – He’s our Dad now), He won’t give up on us. If we don’t leave Him, He won’t leave us. What an eternal hope and joy we have!! No one can ever take that from us.


# Chapter Fifty Four
## Another Cause Of Spiritual Blindness: Ingratitude
*Feb 6, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=154)] 

![](images/154.jpg)

Recently we've heard the exhortation that spiritual blindness comes when we don't keep a clear conscience (Matthew 6:22-23).

I was also meditating on something else that the Bible says causes spiritual blindness:

Romans 1:21 says, *“For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.”*

The reason in a lot of cases that a person can have a darkened heart and miss God altogether is: plain and simple **ingratitude**. *"They did not honor Him as God or give thanks."*

God gave us a million things - life, breathe, everything needed - and most of all His own Son. But the temptation to overlook all of this and focus on the one or two earthly circumstances which are difficult, or focus on some earthly thing which He hasn’t given us can be very strong, even for a Christian. We know how foolish it is - it's like a person discovering they have a winning a $1 million lottery ticket and then getting angry that he got a parking ticket while cashing it, and being downcast for a week over that. It doesn't make sense (logically)! But the temptation is often very real, and is stronger the further we are from walking in closeness with the Lord.

We often talk about the sin of complaining - complaining about what is going wrong, or what God hasn't done or the problems He has left in our life. If we meditate on the seriousness of this sin, we can take it more seriously the next time we are tempted. We can compare it to a beggar who is saved by a man who pushes him out of the way of an oncoming bus. Imagine this man gets hit by the bus instead of the beggar, and he saves the beggars life. Now imagine this beggar instead of thanking and helping this hero who saved him, instead he starts asking the man who saved him (who is now laying on the ground with wounds) if he can give him some money. And then when the man on the ground stays quiet, the beggar scoffs, complains and walks off in frustration.

This ungrateful beggar is a picture of how ugly it looks like to be lacking in gratitude toward the Lord when He doesn’t do some small earthly thing for us which we ask for. He gave us everything – everything eternal that matters, that is:

***Ephesians 1:3*** *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ*

***2 Peter 1:3*** *seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.* 

***Romans 8:32*** *He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?* 

God granted to us *everything* (everything good for our eternal life with Him, that is - He hasn’t held back even one thing). And not only that – but it’s really a wonder to see that what He has **withheld** is also just as much a blessing from love as what He’s given!

I believe with all my heart, if the Lord removed all pressures, and granted all the desires I've had which I thought were good (perhaps even granted many of my past foolish prayers), it’s very possible that I may not even be following Him today. Praise God for *answered* prayers, and praise God for *Unanswered* prayers!

At the end we will all say “He did all things well” – that’s a very common thing to confess this after the Lord does something amazing (Mark 7:37). But to confess this with a quiet trust in the Lord before we can explain, and before everything makes sense – that’s faith, and it's also a great act of humility. Because it's saying "Lord, I don't know - but you do. You're in charge, and that's the way it should be."

And it says here in Romans 1 that to be ungrateful for what He has *already* done for us is such a grave sin that the Bible says - our heart will start to become darkened. It will lead to greater and greater foolishness and drifting from the Lord. It says what God allowed to happen to some after they had such ingratitude to the Lord:

***Romans 1:28*** *And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind*

Their ungrateful heart caused them to have a ‘depraved mind.’

I used to wonder what 1 Cor 16:22 meant: *"If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha."* It sounds extreme, but I believe it’s saying how terrible it is to think that a person wouldn't love the One who gave everything for them. It's inhuman. An animal could easily walk off after a person saved it’s life, and never give thanks. But it’s hard to imagine any human would ever do that. It's more living like an animal, to be ungrateful to the one who gave their life for you. A human should never live at such a low level of life. But sadly, many people live like animals in this regard.

I’ve seen that at times when I focus on my struggles instead of looking to Jesus and all I have in Him, I can start to lose that gratitude. To focus on the weight of my personal struggles has sometimes been the thing which has made me sink the lowest, driven me into the ground under the weight.

But one thing that’s helped me in the hardest times is to literally ‘Count my blessings’ – to think of all the Lord has already done for me, and then also confess and believe in faith that whatever is weighing me down is also worthy of blessing and praising the Lord for. “Lord thank you for the last time you pulled me out of this tight spot – I look at that and know you’ll do it again. Lord thank you for this difficult person, it’s helping refine me and causing me to kill my wretched pride and ego. Lord thank you for this financial struggle, it’s helping me to lean on you more than ever in faith – I never want to trust in man or in money.”

I sometimes use my imagination to think of some things which the Lord will do, how He may work it for my eternal good and for His glory. I love that thought, that our short, light sufferings now which we are faithful in can be glorifying God for all of eternity (2 Cor 4:17). I see Abraham did that with the sacrifice of Isaac (Imagining God would literally raise him from the dead – Heb 11:19), and it was credited to Abraham as faith and righteousness! I wonder if Jesus while He was having His hands nailed to the cross would have imagined how He would be bearing those scars forever, and taken solace that – “These are my wounds of love I can carry for eternity.”

May the Lord open our eyes to areas where we've been ungrateful, or ever felt deserving of anything from the One who's already given us EVERYTHING in Christ (Eph 1:3). And to see that even that which He has withheld – is actually the very giving of a gift itself too.


# Chapter Fifty Five
## Prayer Binds Satan'S Hands, But A Spirit Of Negativity Binds God'S Hands
*Feb 27, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=156)] 

![](images/156.jpg)

INTRODUCTION
 One word which has been encouraging to me for some time is that we have the power with God's help to tie up Satan‘s hands so that he's unable to work as he likes in our life. I take that promise for my own life from this verse:

Matthew 18:18 *"Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven."*

God defeated Satan with the cross, completely taking his power away, but the Lord wants us to join in that work now by working with Him and in union with other disciples to 'bind' Satan's (and all his agents) hands up to where they can't work. One day the devil will be thrown into the lake of fire forever and even he himself will be tormented (Rev 20:10)! Praise God! But today he's roaming around and working as much as he can until the time the Lord has set.

BINDING SATAN'S HANDS
 So Satan is desiring to cause disaster in in our homes, in our marriages, in our churches, and in our own hearts - but we have the power to bind his works by praying, and by praying in unity. Husband and wife can bind things in their children’s lives, members in the church can bind things when they pray with one another, etc. See again in Matthew 18 verse 19, *"Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven."*

So that's binding Satan's hands. But there’s another verse which is very interesting in Matthew 13:58, and also similarly in Mark 6:5-6 - that says that the Lord was not able to do many works for His own hometown because they had such unbelief:

Matt 13:58 *"And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief."*
 Mark 6:6:5-6 *"And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. And He wondered at their unbelief..."*

BINDING GOD'S HANDS

We say we want to bind Satan's hands, but I believe we read in this verse itself that we by our unbelief may be tying ropes instead around God's hands in our life! Maybe He’s able to work in many other people's lives the way He wants, but with regard to my own life His hands may be tied if I have unbelief! Wow.

Imagine the Father reaching down from Heaven to (figuratively) lift up a boy and care and comfort and encourage him. And as the Father is reaching down from Heaven to help this boy, the boy reaches up to His Father's hands... but he doesn't take His loving hands and hold them and receive His loving care; instead the boy places handcuffs on His Dad's wrists, and then takes a rope and wraps up the wrists and hands that were reaching down to lift him up! I believe this is exactly what we do when we don’t trust our Father, and we don’t believe He can help. When we focus not on the hope and promises we have in Christ, and His power, but instead on how bad the situation is.

NEGATIVITY
 I think one word for this which often sums up unbelief is: "Negativity". A spirit of negativity is the spiritual equivalent of tying ropes around the hands of the Father who is trying to reach down to pick me up and love me.

I sometimes had to repent of and ask God to forgive me for my ‘sighs’ of negativity. I don't always use words, but have often let out a ‘sigh’ of unbelief that with my groan was actually in reality saying "Oh great I have to deal with this again." And when I think about what it implies I have to admit that it is saying that what God has chosen to allow is bad. It's not for my good (it denies the plain truth of Romans 8:28). Or at least, with my negativity I'm confessing that the trouble/hassle of the trial is not worth the good that it would bring.

But there's something important about faith: Faith is not just believing that what God says is true, but it's also believing that it's as valuable as He says it is! It's not only believing His Word, but believing it to the point that we're enthusiastic about it (I believe we see this in the parables of the treasure/pearl of great price Matthew 13:44-45). And so I've seen I have to repent of negativity.

We have to have a constant attitude of faith that just as the Lord turned the worst thing that ever happened in the universe (the death of Jesus) into the best thing (Jesus dying for us, rising again and saving us forever) - we have to be confident every ‘bad’ thing is not bad, it’s actually good if we love the Lord, and if it's fully submitted to Him so that He can do something with it. And it's not just 'good', but it's REALLY REALLY good!

A faith filled Christian MUST be an optimistic Christian. Always hopeful, always patient, exulting in tribulation instead of cursing it. Romans 5:3-4 "And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; 5:4 and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;"
 "Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation" (Rom 12:12),
 Be "imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises" (Heb 6:12)

CONCLUSION

So I see now more of the seriousness with which I need to take unbelief, when I see what it is – unbelief actually is tying up the hands of God so that He cannot work.

Unbelief is not an 'innocent sin', committed by poor unlucky people who deserve pity from a God who has been too hard on them! It’s tying ropes around the very One who’s loved us from the beginning, and Who wants to help us even more than we want to help ourselves. But accepting every single situation that comes our way (both good, and difficult) as from His loving hand is what frees Him up to work mightily in our life, and also is the very thing we can do which pleases Him (Heb 11:6).

## The Blessed Path Of Suffering (Part 1 Of 3)

[The Blessed Path Of Suffering (Part 3 of 3)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=157)

INTRO

One of first messages I heard online that really helped me to deal with trials was called, “The blessed path of suffering” by Brother Zac Poonen ( <https://www.cfcindia.com/sermon/the-blessed-path-of-suffering> ). When I first heard it I was in my early 20s. And as I’ve had various trials over the years, going through this path of suffering, I definitely have found it to be a path that has been growing to be not just more bearable, but more sweet - more than I’ve ever thought possible when I first heard this message.

So I wanted to talk about our journey along this path, and what it’s like. As I've experienced different struggles over the years, some small, and others much more difficult, I believe we can sum this path in 3 phases. I also believe we can see these phases in the lives of people in the Bible too, such as the apostle Paul.

PHASE 1

Along the path of suffering at first it I would have described this path as: unbearable. Of course it's not (because 1 Corinthians 10:13 promises that it never will be), but often the start of this path may feel unbearable, we don’t know how we will go on, how we will live many or even the rest of our months or years with such a weight of burden. A large part of the weight is not knowing how long it will go on! We may have thoughts of “I wish I could just fast-forward past this... or even fast-forward to Heaven.”

I believe we can even see the apostle Paul had some points in his life where he felt like this, where he felt his immense suffering pushing him to his limits:

2 Corinthians 1:8 *"For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life"*

Paul was mature at the point, so He had trust in the Lord (v9), but if our faith is still small at first and we are still starting out, we may be like a child at the doctor who is about to get a shot, we spend a lot of time screaming (inwardly) and trying to figure out a way off this path. What we may not see yet is that if we take a shortcut such as complaining to everyone of our problems, or by solving them with money or schemes of men, or clever plans and thinking, then we’ve wasted the path, and we won't discover the blessedness of what’s coming.

We learn to keep crying to the Lord for deliverance, and seek the Lord for that if possible. Paul did that - seeking to be delivered from the suffering (2 Cor 12:8), and that's a good thing. This is where we're learning the habit of going to the Lord frequently, and that's what He wants! Us who were so used to coming along just fine without even thinking about God all day - here on this path we can learn to keep talking to God and going back to Him for help, walking with Him, recognizing His presence with us all the time. What a blessed path to learn this! When anxieties and sorrows are continuing to come - we keep going to God. The constant pressure pushes us out of necessity to stay close to the Lord. It's like if we were in a small room with Jesus, the pressure of the suffering is like a big balloon in the middle that is blowing up so that it squeezes us and pushes us right up close to the Lord, there's nowhere else for us to move or go.

Philippians 4:6 *Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.*

In this phase we do not ‘feel’ it is a blessing. It’s very dark on this part of the path, we can’t see yet the immensity of the blessing of it yet. I've heard that an infant at first can't see very well. So we are like that too, and here at this point we have to learn the habit of faith: of continuously confessing it according to God’s promises and what we know to be true, such as Rom 8:28; not what we FEEL to be true. This is an act of faith. We have to walk by faith which means with every step we take we have to confess ‘this is a blessing’. It doesn’t feel like a blessing, it doesn’t look like it - that doesn't matter. It is a blessing. Many times we stumble and start to complain instead of praise, we’re not perfect or mature yet - but if we keep repenting and coming back to the Lord and His Word and confessing that, and if we continue on in this habit of faith like this, soon we will start to see the reward and enter into the next phase of this blessed path.

Here we also start to learn through the school of suffering to resign ourselves to the Lord’s will, to say ‘not mine but yours’ - to lay ourselves on the altar. This is where that test is, and if we continue in it, then in the next phase we will have the ability to say with a genuine heart as Jesus confessed ‘What shall I say, save me from this hour? No, Father glorify thy name.’ When I was first saved, my mind was still very much consumed with myself - what I would get out of God, primarily forgiveness and Heaven. God saves many people like this, but none of us should stay like this. This path is where we start to be delivered from all that poison of self-centeredness.

Another thing about this path is that it's well hidden: it’s very well covered so that no one else on earth sees the depth of our suffering inwardly - it’s secret- between an individual and God Himself. That way we start to learn here to walk before God’s face alone, and lean on Him alone. No human being can solve our problems, it has to be our Father Himself, we have to find HIM alone as our refuge and strength (Psalm 46:1), and learn what it is to go to the Lord and find strength (1 Sam 30:6).

But then along the way we come onto the next phase on the path, if we have been faithful to keep going, keep believing, keep repenting and going to the Lord, and to get up when we fall.

## The Blessed Path Of Suffering (Part 2 Of 3)

[The Blessed Path Of Suffering (Part 3 of 3)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=157)

PHASE 2

The next phase on the path of suffering is ‘Bearable.’ The path is still difficult, but as we’ve been faithful to lean on the Lord, we are finding His grace is sufficient (2 Cor 12:9) (grace = God's strength/power to rise above and overcome sin and our circumstances).

We used to think we ‘knew’ so much of this truth, but now as we’ve been living it, we are experiencing some genuine ‘feeling’ in our heart the truth of it. The truth is coming down from our head to our heart. Praise God! We are being changed inwardly by His Holy Spirit. Nobody can change themselves no more than a leopard can change its spots (Jer 13:23), but by the power of God's Holy Spirit, our character is ACTUALLY changing from the inside! This is a miracle.

We’re like a bird learning to fly, rising above our circumstances - we’re starting to pop our head out above the storm, we’re walking on top of water more and more.

And we look back and see how ignorant we were, and we start to recognize, "If there was so much I thought I knew then and didn't... there must be even more I need to know, which I don't know now! More victory to obtain, which I haven't yet. I was just scratching the surface!" This path has the most opportunity to grow in humility than in any other path.

Also as we look back we can see how as we’ve followed this path it has been cleansing us of much selfishness and pride that was there within ourselves. We’re seeing the value of it. And we have more gratitude to the Lord for it, and we start recognizing "I desperately need to continue down this path. I need this suffering to cleanse me." This is similar to when Paul said, “I need this suffering so I don’t puff up with pride” (2 Cor 12:7).

In phase 1 we found ourselves ‘thinking’ a lot; our minds constantly revolving around the problem to try to answer many questions like ‘why’ and ‘how’ to fix it. But now in this phase we move into the realm of LEANING. During my path of suffering the Lord has spoken to my heart a word that has helped me - ‘Less Thinking, More Leaning.’ It has really helped me. And in this we oddly find that our leaning accomplishes much more than all our years of wasted thinking and worrying put together!

Here in this phase of the path we are learning more and more to ‘rejoice.’ We are tested and have to choose to rejoice - to not lose the joy of the Lord in the midst of what used to feel like torment (James 1:2). I remember one time I was having a struggle and the Lord spoke a word to my heart so clearly: "It is critical that you don't lose your joy in Me here." I had always treated joy as a "nice to have", but I hadn't seen how critical it is. It was then I saw that if we lose our joy we lose our strength (Nehemiah 8:10), and if we lose our strength we lose the battle. We have to fight for joy, it is not enough to just 'not sin' in the trial - it is also critical to not lose the joy of the Lord at any cost. And this phase of the path gives us plenty of opportunity to learn this fight for joy, which is just as much a command to stay in as any other (Php 4:4).

And then we can discover a very odd lesson that we never knew, which couldn't be explained to us - it has to be lived out. It's the lesson that: Joy is a choice. Peace is a choice. Anxiety is a choice. Before this we thought that these things sort of just 'happen' to us. But as we've seen God's power more clearly, we learn that the reason why these are choices is because God’s given us the complete power by the Spirit to surrender and rejoice, to rise above every sin, above every anxiety or lack of joy (Rom 6:14). If God gave me the power, and ability, and opportunity to rise above the suffering (1 Cor 10:13) and I am not doing that, then it has to only because of one reason: it was my own choice to remain in slavery. Why would a slave who has been set free stay in slavery? Because it was his own choice. I can't blame people, or the difficulty, or God Himself. We can learn in this phase to crush every seed of blame that creeps up in our heart and to come to the point that David had to come to, which is "I'm the man" (2 Sam 12:7-13).

If our suffering is due to someone else, we pray faithfully God won’t hold it against them, and we start to genuinely desire their good. We see our battle is not with them (against flesh and blood - Eph 6:12), but with Satan and all the forces of darkness who are laboring behind the scenes, and with our own flesh. We start to have our eyes opened to see these things in the spiritual realm, and it’s an additional comfort and challenge and encouragement for us to be faithful, and keep laboring in the war alongside Jesus. There's so much more going on inwardly and spiritually than we see in these small outward circumstances. Every step down the path is becoming lighter and easier as we can see more clearly the Lord's plan, as we're growing in zeal to fight the kingdom of darkness and its ally which is inside me (my flesh), and to trust the Lord with bigger faith for the many things we still don't see.

[The Blessed Path Of Suffering (Part 2 of 3)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=158)

PHASE 3

The last phase on this path of suffering is a very unexpected and welcome one: Sweetness.

In my own life, I've seen that I've developed the deepest intimacy with the Lord I’ve ever had before when I was under the heaviest weights of suffering. Before, we had no idea how deep into this life with Jesus we could go, and we are seeing how we were just scratching the surface but we've "Tasted and seen the Lord is good" (Psalm 34:8), so we want more. We genuinely rejoice in the suffering. There’s an inward satisfaction and happiness that we get to partake of such a way.

We count it a privilege to go the same way of so many saints who have had such difficult lives but out of the pressure was squeezed such sweet juice, an aroma pleasing to God.

And we appreciate more than ever the path our Lord went, He was the first, our forerunner in it (Heb 6:20).

It becomes much more natural to count it all joy when we enter various trials (James 1:2), since we've clung to God's promises through the first two phases, now we are partaking of His nature more and more (2 Pet 1:4). There’s an odd thought of ‘What if I lose this suffering?’ Because with all our heart we do not want to lose a closeness with the Lord that we’ve learned on this blessed path, we fear anything other. But we can take refuge in the words of Paul that what the Lord has taught us in suffering we can take with us in future times of ease, ‘I have learned to be content’... being well fed or having little (Philippians 4:12). We don’t ever have to lose this sweet life with God and Jesus again even if things get easier, or whether more suffering comes.

It’s secret and can’t be explained, but we count ourselves privileged that the Lord was so gracious to give us such a life on this blessed path. Our song is, "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places." (Psalm 16:6)

What was once the thing which would seem to end us, now we count as our salvation and refuge. And it's true: ‘With difficulty the righteous are saved’ (1 Pet 4:18)

1 Peter 4:13 *"But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. 4:14 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."*

God's glory becomes paramount in our life. Like Jesus, as we feel the blow of suffering, our prayers are no longer ‘Father save me’ but they are ‘Father, glorify your name’ (John 12:27-28). We can see the outstanding privilege it is to give God glory and bow low before Him through suffering. It's the way Job went when he said, "The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away... blessed be the name of the Lord." And it's the way Jesus went. If God gets glory through our voluntarily laying ourselves down on an altar of suffering, we can rejoice and happily lay down on that altar! May we be looking up as we are laying there on that altar and see His smile and His pleasure as He is being glorified. That will be what carries us through the path with joy, especially when it hurts the most. "For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross" (Heb 12:2).

One last thing I want to mention is a very amazing thing I believe happens especially in this phase: we find ourselves able to overflow and bless others who are suffering in a way we never would have if we would have been delivered right away. 2 Corinthians 1 is a divine calling for us not to waste our suffering but to use it to bless others who are suffering today in the same way we did in the past. 1 Cor 10:13 says that the suffering we have, it's not uncommon. Others are going through the same, they have before, and they will continue to. But now we can be an overflow of God's love and support for others who are further back in the path. We find in ourselves a supernatural ability to do it from the Holy Spirit's overflow in us - a love and sympathy, encouraging words from God's mouth that we can share with them. We can "sustain a weary one with a word" (Isaiah 50:4), but this only came because God led us down this blessed path first where we suffered, and were humiliated - but by the grace of God we set our face like flint (strong perseverance) and made it through (Isaiah 50:6). And so the result is we have a tongue now which is able to lift a weary one with a word.

It really is a miracle straight from God to genuinely feel we are the most privileged to suffer. We despise the lusts we used to have for an easy life, because we don't need it anymore like we thought we did before - quite the opposite! We see how miserable it would be to come into the last day and not have anything to lay down at the Lord’s feet (Rev 4:10, 3:11) - but our faithful suffering, where we drew near and sung a song of praise through it - we can have something to give the Lord. Where He gets pleasure out of our life. We will be able to sing this song for eternity that not everyone will be able to sing, only those who humbled themselves before God here on earth and praised the Lord, making it through this blessed path of suffering (Revelation 14:3).

May we find a closeness with the Lord, a song we can sing to Him, and a crown that we can take with us into eternity to give to Him, which we gained on our sweet, "blessed path of suffering.”

Difficult became bearable, then bearable became sweet - and we are becoming like Jesus. Praise the Lord.

May we joyfully continue down this sweet path the rest of our days.

****"And above the rest this note shall swell,****

****My Jesus doeth all things well."****


# Chapter Fifty Nine
## Two Wolves
*Apr 4, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=166)] 

![](images/166.jpg)

Galatians 6:7 *"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."*

A STORY:

I once heard a simple children’s parable about two wolves:

A young boy once felt that he had two wolves inside of him. One wolf was good and the other was evil. Those two wolves were often fighting each other. When the good wolf would win the boy would do good (such as say a kind word, obey his parents, help someone, share his toys, and refrain from saying bad things). But when the bad wolf inside of him would win the boy wouldn't be able to control himself in the moment, and he would choose to do bad. The boy wanted to do good, but he didn’t know how to help the good wolf win.

So he asked his Dad about it, he told him of his struggle of the good and the bad wolves which were inside of him. And he asked his Dad, "How can I help the good wolf win, and the bad wolf to lose?" And his Dad said, "That's easy; ****the wolf that will win is the one you feed the most****. Feed the good wolf, and he will get stronger. Starve the bad wolf and he will get weaker. Then the good wolf will win."

I believe the moral of this story is what was written in the Bible 2000 years ago:

*“For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.”* ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭6:8-9‬ ‭NASB‬‬

When our flesh (self-will) is eating really well, it comes be very intense with whatever we've been feeding it. Physically, if it's been feeding on a lot of sugar, it will start to crave sweets more and more, and in the same way - if it has been feeding on gossip articles online, for example, I believe it will become very strong in its judgment of others. If it has been constantly feeding on material things - constantly gazing at the latest products, gadgets, and designer clothes - it will desire them more and become more covetous. THE CURRENT SEASON

The same goes with fear. In this current season, I believe that many (Christians even) can be paralyzed by fear if they are feeding their mind on the multitudes of negative things the unbelieving world is telling them - maybe it's their friends, coworkers, relatives, or online feeds which preach fear, doom and gloom, instead of God's Word of His love for us, and His sovereign control of every situation.

Proverbs 4:23 says that it's critical to guard our heart diligently. I understand my "heart" to mean: my inner thoughts, intentions, and desires. I used to think that it wasn't possible to change what I desire, and what I unconsciously think about all day... that it sort of just, "happens." But I've learned that that's absolutely not true.

I've seen that ****much of what I desire and unconsciously think about today, is the result of what I've been recently choosing to 'sow' into my mind for the past week, or month, or so****.

What we choose to feed or withhold from our flesh *today* has a direct effect on the strength of our flesh *tomorrow*.

THE NEWS

We have to be careful what we are feeding on in the news, for example. I've noticed that a lot of the news today isn't really news (facts about what's going on in the world) - it's merely people expressing their opinion about something - bashing this politician here, criticizing this nation there, guessing at what's going to happen here. It's similar to junk food - it ruins the appetite for what's really healthy, rather than building us up as God's Word does.

It's not right to say that we should be 'ignorant' and refrain from reading the news altogether. Even Jesus was informed about current events - Luke 13:4. But I've seen for myself, I need to be able to know when the Holy Spirit is saying, "This is not the right article to read", or when He's saying, "That's enough."

Col 3:15 *"Let the peace of God be your referee"* (And listen to His whistle-blows when you're about to go out of bounds!)

I remember being over at someone’s house and a boy was playing video games there. The Dad said to his son who had been playing video games, “Ok son that’s enough for now.” It was a good example to me of "moderation." Have you ever heard the Lord say “That’s enough”, and stopped doing something? Maybe it was an unprofitable conversation, or spending a long time on the internet... not anything sinful... just the excess of something. If the Lord tells you "that’s enough" would you stop immediately? I see that's the question I often run into throughout many days in some area or another. The Holy Spirit is not being a 'killjoy'... (God's commands are not meant to make me miserable) - it's for my protection. If I continue past that point, then I enter the realm of sowing to the flesh, and the flesh will get stronger, and I will be feeling the consequences of it later. Maybe in intense fear, or preoccupation with something... or a lack of desire for the Lord and His Word. ****"Junk food" may be lawful, but in excess it will always ruin our appetite for what's healthy.****

But If we regularly feed on time with the Lord, and His Word, good teaching, books and sermons, etc - we will find our spirit very strong, and our mind being transformed (Romans 12:2). Our mind is constantly being transformed with what we feed it. And the amazing result is "eternal life" as it says: "*the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life."* And eternal life, we know is intimate fellowship with our Father, and with Jesus; to know Him (John 17:3). If we are feeding on the right things we will grow in knowing the Lord, and we will grow to be strong.

Daniel 11:32 *"Those who know their God will be strong" (in spirit)*

May the Lord help us to be wise and sow to the Spirit today, and be careful what we are feeding on. So that our mind and our heart can be transformed to think and see things like He does, and then we will feel like He does about things - free from fear, walking above the storm of panic which the world is caught up in today. And this comes though denying the small desires of the flesh everyday that contradict God’s will, and obeying the quiet whisper of the Spirit in every little thing - even 'This isn't the right article to read'. It’s much better to obey the whispers of the Spirit today than to try to quiet down our screaming flesh later!

## Don'T Judge According To Personality
*Apr 26, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=170)] 

![](images/170.jpg)

*“Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God.”*

‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭4:5‬ ‭NASB‬‬

INTRO

My favorite fruit is a pineapple. I could eat those everyday, they're really refreshing and taste so good. The only bad part about them is they are a bit hard and rough on the outside. They’re not much to look at, but once you get them open they're delicious!

I think that some personalities may be like pineapples - very rough on the outside, but inside they're very sweet. Perhaps the culture or home a person was brought up in didn’t teach them manners, or how to correctly interact with other people in conversation, for example. That doesn’t mean there’s not a heart full of God’s love on the inside.

Other personalities can be like lemons - they appear very nice on the outside. I think the yellow color of a lemon is one of the most bright and attractive of any fruit. But I’d never want to eat one by itself! They’re so sour inside.

There’s a man who is so polite, opening the doors for strangers, letting others go in line first, never missing a “please”, and “thank you.” But inside there may be buckets full of judgment, pride, selfishness and bitterness. And if it came down to getting that promotion at work or cheating someone to save some money, they may do it in a heartbeat! They’re very well mannered when their self-life is not at stake, but if you put them in a situation where they’re about to lose something and you will see the true self come out.

On the other hand, imagine a brother in the church who isn’t so refined - he doesn’t really smile or laugh at your jokes. He doesn’t keep long conversations with you. Or maybe it's the other way around - perhaps this person talks too much and is too direct, saying some things that rub you the wrong way. Maybe he didn't like your new haircut and made a subtle comment about it. And you think "That was rude." And that thought keeps coming back to you, "I still can't believe this guy said that." And from that point on, without saying it you unconsciously avoid him because of this one little comment. And Satan is so happy to cause rifts because of your little root of bitterness that’s growing. There's death in that root of bitterness though... because one thing about roots is they grow, and spread to others :

*"See to it that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled".* (Heb 12:15)

And then it’s possible that on the last day you may be shocked to see that this person was one of the most faithful one to pray for you in secret, he had a real burden for you. It was just a personality quirk of his, mixed with your sensitivity about how you look that caused all this trouble.

Personality does not equal Christ-likeness. Love does. (1 Jn 4:8)

Some family members may not call you, or go out of their way to spend time with you. You may wonder why.

It’s best to assume the best about people. Do not go on judging before the time (1 Cor 4:5)

Maybe on the outside a family member often keeps to themselves, and you think they don’t care about you. But when you’re in some deep need they may be the first ones there to help you. It was just their personality, they weren’t as social of a person and tended to like more time alone. But their heart was full of love for you!

Why doesn’t God judge everyone now? It’s because there’s a day set for it - In the future... and He's very patient. He routinely gives 60,80,90 years for people to repent, and that's nothing for Him. He gave Israel many many centuries to repent! It seems like we barely give people 3 minutes to get their acts straight before we start deciding to hold some grudge! And we have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes, inside of them, what they’ve gone through, what they’re dealing with now in secret. Even spouses don’t know each other that intimately.

One of the most important aspects of our walk with God is to acknowledge my mind is like a little cup of water, and God's wisdom is like an ocean - I have such a small understanding of what God is doing in and through other people. This is why faith is so important. If I could figure out and understand/comprehend everything I could judge rightly - people, situations, etc. But I can’t. That's why faith and to trust the Lord is so critical, and to keep a clean heart toward others.

*“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”* (Matt 5:8)

We should aim to be absolutely pure and spotless hearts, to cleanse our hearts - pure with no mark of any negative thought or judgment about others, even if it is true. God is extremely merciful, rooting for every single person to repent (2 Pet 3:9), overlooking so much sin, patiently waiting. He will not judge before the time, and neither should we.

CONCLUSION

The Lord has challenged me to overlook all roughness on the outside I see in anybody. Any quirks or what I see as negatives in their personality; be blind to those, just as the Lord is so graciously blind to my own sin and immaturities. I've shared before many times what the Lord spoke to me that has helped me in situations with difficult people - the most important thing to understand about difficult people is that I'm one of them. When I think of that it helps the bitterness against another to flee, and helps me to remember God's tremendous patience and mercy He constantly has with me.

Those that get offended easily over small things like that in other people will never be able to build the church, and they will have massive regret when they find out on the last day that this person who was very rough on the outside had a heart of gold that loved the Lord more than anything. And they missed how blessed they could have been by many years of fellowship with this one, if they had only overlooked some small thing.

*"Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you."* (Ephesians 4:32)


# Chapter Sixty One
## The Way That Seems Right
*Jul 1, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=177)] 

![](images/177.jpg)

Proverbs 14:12 *"There is a way which seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death."*

I remember one time when I was young I was visiting a church with a friend and his family, and I had been feeling that I wanted to give some money to the Lord since I hadn't been to a church in a long time and there hadn't been a chance for me to. So this one day when I visited this church I brought some money along thinking, maybe there's a chance to give to God. At the end of the service they passed around an offering box, and I felt good putting that money in the box, like I had given to God. But then I was shocked when after the collection, the visiting preacher there announced he wanted to pass the offering boxes around one more time, so that the pastor (who was out of town at the time) would come back and be happily surprised! I may have been young but even I could recognize the evil of wanting to "make pastor happy by giving big double-offerings." But there was no taking the cash back out of the box now. What's done was done, I had already wasted the money by giving it to that church. Soon after I found out unsurprisingly that the church and the pastor were preaching the prosperity gospel, and the pastor was living very lavishly from his church earnings. I felt so horrible that I dishonored the Lord with HIS money because I didn't listen to Him and I just jumped at the first thought of what I assumed was good. So I had to repent of that.

I regret giving that money to such a church, but I'm thankful that it taught me to be careful with God's money from there on out when giving it somewhere. And it taught me not to just assume I know what's good and right, without seeking the Lord first.

One characteristic I've seen in the godly saints I've known and the ones who I read about (both in the Bible and in church history) is that: when making decisions, they don't immediately assume they know the right way. They don't make quick, off the cuff decisions. They don't get excited too quickly about some new path that opens up to them that seems good. They recognize their immense lack and ability to completely fall short apart from God, and so they are careful to go to the Lord for awhile and listen, as they go forward in life and make decisions. In other words they are 'led by the Spirit' (Rom 8:14). They are "needy" for guidance. "Blessed are the poor in spirit (needy)" (Matt 5:3). They are aware of their shortcoming and absolute incapability to do anything good apart from God (even Jesus was like this! John 5:30).

Proverbs 16:25 *"There is a way which seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death."*

This is exactly the same verse (word for word) as the previous verse we saw in Proverbs chapter 14, written two chapters apart in Proverbs. The fact that this verse is written twice in exactly the same way emphasizes to me how important it is.

So I was reminded to beware of the "this seems like it's right" attitude.

One thing that's helped me avoid that careless attitude, is if I very quickly feel I have peace about some important decision, first give the Lord a period of time with the decision (before acting on it) to totally submit it to Him, and allow Him to override it. Allow Him a chance to reveal to me if that's what He's really speaking, or close a door. Keep it surrendered on the altar. Then at the end He can either confirm it or show me otherwise, but either way I can move forward with peace that it was His decision, and not just "the way that seemed right" to me.

If I had that attitude when I was visiting that church when I was younger I believe I could have easily recognized "This is God's money, and I'm about to do something with it... I need to ask Him, and be careful with it." I believe He would have stopped me and told me not to be hasty. He could have showed me something about the very "showy" music being played there and put a hesitation in my heart, or He could have warned me that I didn't know enough about the church yet to be able to make a wise decision. He could have spoken something to me about foolish youthful zeal, which does a lot on the outside, but accomplishes nothing for the kingdom of God.

Most work and good works for the Lord today are like a man rowing in a canoe in the pitch black dark of night, and on the last day when the morning sun comes up he will see that his boat was tied to a tree the whole time and all his labors were wasted, and he got nowhere. If he would have only listened to the One who can see in the dark!

The Lord will guide us in the right way, and will produce real lasting fruit for Him, only if we lean on Him and listen "constantly at His gate" (Prov 8:34) so that we can know we're in His will before going forward. Even if we don't hear a 100% clear word from the Lord right away, we can at least listen for a little whisper and even if we are wrongly hearing or make a wrong decision sometime, as long as we are sincerely wanting to do His will and not ours, we honor Him with the fact that we went to Him first before taking a step. Because a good Father is pleased by his child not necessarily getting perfect grades, but trying their best. And we have the Best Father!

Colossians 1:9 *For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 10 so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;*

[The A-Z of Pride - Printable Single Page Summary](https://nccf.church/Articles/A-ZofPrideSinglePage.pdf)

### **A**

Pride loves ATTENTION and honor from men (Matt 23:5-6). It loves compliments and flattery. The humble fear this since they recognize the temptation to steal God's glory. The humble follow the principle to "Serve God then run away", such as Jesus did when people tried to make Him king (John 6:15). We may not be able to run away from these moments *physically*, but *in our heart* we should be running away from all temptations to indulge in proud thoughts and steal the glory of God.

Pride does many good works while secretly hoping someone noticed, being happy at the thought that someone apart from God may be thinking well of us.

### **B**

Pride is a spirit of BLAME. When something goes wrong, it assumes some other person or situation is at fault, and points the finger (Matt 7:3, Isa 58:9). The proud make excuses when it is their fault, and can easily find reason why their mistake is actually the fault of another.

### **C**

Pride is COMPARISON. It's one piece of dust saying to another piece of dust "look at how great I am, because I’m a bit bigger than you." (Psalm 103:14, 2 Cor 10:12)

### **D**

Pride is DISOBEDIENCE to God.

The main characteristic of humility was shown in Jesus' obedience even to the point of death (Php 2:8). Pride is plain and simple disobedience to the Lord in anything.

### **E**

Pride is ENTITLEMENT, it's feeling that we deserve something from anyone, because of who we are or what we've done. For example: it is unwilling to be frugal in money because it feels entitled to buy what it likes. Or it can be an unwillingness to eat simple food, or take a simple vacation rather than a more luxurious one. Humility is never entitled, but keeps an attitude of unworthiness/undeservedness (Luke 17:10, Luke 5:8). Humility recognizes that all we have comes from God (1 Cor 4:7).

### **F**

Pride loves to FIGHT (it is contentious, very quick to argue). It sets itself to quarrel as long as it takes, until it wins the argument.

Humility is letting the other person win the argument, and then changing the conversation to something else you can agree on without fighting, like sports or the weather.

### **G**

Pride GLORIES in past good works it has done.

Pride is revisiting the good works we’ve done in our mind and patting ourselves on the back, taking satisfaction in what we've done "with our own hands" instead of giving God the glory (Daniel 4:30-37).

### **H**

Pride is very HARSH with other people in words or actions, it's lacking in a critical fruit of the Spirit: gentleness (Gal 5:23). Humility is gentleness (careful not to harm another even in little ways, such as a careless hurtful word or joke about someone).

But pride leads to uncontrolled anger that ends up lashing out in harsh ways at others.

### **I**

Pride is IMPATIENT. For example, a proud person gets quickly frustrated with a coworker who is slow to respond, with a slow driver on the road, or with a crying child because he feels he deserves much quiet time to himself.

### **J**

Pride JUSTIFIES itself (Luke 16:15), and JUDGES others, looking down on others in the heart (Matt 7:1). It often joins hands with the accuser (Rev 12:10), focusing on the sins of others, and excusing its own sins.

### **K**

Pride often gets puffed up with KNOWLEDGE (1 Cor 8:1).

Pride is assuming that we see and understand things more clearly than others.

### **L**

Pride is having LOFTY thoughts of ourself (Romans 12:3).

Pride assumes we are indispensable in the kingdom of God or at our occupation, for example. Both will get along fine without us after we are gone! I once heard a saying, "The graveyards are filled with indispensable people." So many millions of "important" people in the past have lived and died, but the world kept on going. 1 Peter 1:24-25

### **M**

Pride is MISERLY. Not only with its money, but with its time. It can often get offended when someone asks a favor of us, as if they have no right to.

This is because it considers my plans and obligations as more important than somebody else's; so it is unwilling to be inconvenienced. For example, pride is fixing lunch for myself if I’m hungry but leaving my kids without food until they get cranky and start asking. Or it's consistently leaving messes for my wife to clean up, without considering her work. Jesus cleaned up even a small linen cloth after He was resurrected (John 20:7). Humility is very considerate of others (Php 2:4).

Pride is being consistently too busy to help my spouse or child with little things. It's is an unwillingness to be interrupted.

### **N**

Pride is being NOSY. It's being a busybody in other people's matters (2 Thess 3:11) - pride assumes that we deserve to know what's going on in another person's life or that our opinion about it matters.

### **O**

Pride is very OPINIONATED about many matters outside of the things of God.

Jesus was not very opinionated outside of the things of God. We should hold tightly to God's word, but outside of that it's possible to be very strongly opinionated as well, expressing our strong feelings about such and such matter which has nothing to do with us. Paul said, "I will not boast in anything except for in the cross of Christ" (Gal 6:14). I heard a saying once which blessed me; "The more we grow in Christ the less eager we are to share our own opinions."

### **P**

Pride is PRESUMPTION: it's the assumption that I know what's going to happen in the future, or holding tightly to my own plans which I for sure will carry out (James 4:14-16) - we should only say "If the Lord wills it." Pride depends on self (and is quite confident in it!), rather than God.

### **Q**

Pride is QUICK to speak, and slow to listen, rather than the other way around (James 1:19).

A proud person loves talking about himself a lot - pride assumes that my life is more interesting than that of another. A proud person often dominates a conversation.

The proud don’t listen very carefully to sermons or when reading Scripture since they feel they are pretty good people already, they may listen or read for knowledge which they can boast about later, but the humble have a keen eye and ear specifically for *personal application they can take for themselves* since they recognize their need and want to improve in the areas of their need/sin. The ear of need is what Jesus referred to as "ears to hear" (Matt 11:15).

Pride is being very eager to share with others what the Lord has showed us (because we feel clever and want to impress people), but not valuing the other truths that our brothers and sisters have to share. It’s being very interested to speak, but having little interest to listen.

### **R**

Pride is the ROOT of every sin.

Grace is God's power to keep me from sin (Rom 6:14, 2 Cor 12:9), and God gives grace to the humble (1 Pet 5:5). That means: if I sinned, I didn't get grace because there was pride in me somewhere. At the root of every sin is pride.

### **S**

Pride refuses SERVING in 'Low' tasks (which we consider 'below' us), either in the home (like washing dishes or doing laundry), or in the workplace, such as some menial task which we consider someone else’s job. Humility is quietly willing to take the low, dirty responsibilities which nobody else wants (John 13:14).

### **T**

The proud are THANKLESS and ungrateful, since they feel they are quite deserving of the good that comes to them.

The proud may sing praise songs on Sundays but know nothing of thanking the Lord from the depths of their heart in secret, praising Him with a hymn of thanks in their heart when no one else sees, because they do not really believe they are that sinful and needed the Lord's mercy all that much (Luke 7:47).

### **U**

Pride is UNFORGIVING and UNAPOLOGETIC. Pride stays cold against someone even after they’ve apologized for wrongs against us. And it refuses to acknowledge or apologize for a wrong it has committed.

Pride gets offended when rebuked or corrected (Prov 15:5). In that case, pride defends itself or worse - criticizes the one giving the rebuke.

### **V**

Pride is VENGEFUL.

In subtle ways pride will hold a grudge, such as keeping a cold shoulder against someone for some time, even if on the outside they say with their mouth "I forgive you." (Romans 12:19)

### **W**

Pride is WITHOUT SYMPATHY for the suffering of others, and it's full of jealousy for the success of others.

Since it is so self-centered, pride can easily rejoice in its own ease and comfort, even while a brother is deeply mourning. Its attitude is "I'm glad that didn't happen to me." Alternately, it is easily jealous and so it doesn't rejoice when a brother or sister is rejoicing. (Romans 12:15)

### **X**

Pride is placing EXpectations on others.

We are not God that we should command people what they should do and expect so many things from them. But pride gets angry at others when they don’t do what we want - even toward the Lord Himself.

Pride makes demands from God for selfish reasons that aren’t promised in His Word - James 4:2-3

### **Y**

Pride is very unYIELDING and stubborn. It will not consider or yield to the opinion or desire of another, it will not back down until it gets its way. Jesus granted the request of even a demon when it asked to be cast into pigs! (Mark 5:12-13)

But the motto of pride is "MY will be done."

### **Z**

Pride is ZEALOUS for one's own honor (Matt 23:6), and self preservation. Pride is thinking only about myself and my family, and unconcern for others outside of that circle. It is void of genuine love and concern for others.


# Chapter Sixty Three
## Reasons Not To Worry - Part 1
*Oct 12, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=186)] 

![](images/186.jpg)

*Proverbs 28:1 "The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, But the righteous are bold as a lion."*

*(This blog is part 1 of 2. The second blog is here):*

[Reasons not to worry (Part 2)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=187)

INTRO:

The Bible says that in the last days men will be fainting from fear (Luke 21:26). There's been a lot going on recently that a lot of the world is worried about, fear is definitely increasing.

There's a lot of temptation to dwell on "what ifs" and "what's going to happen" these days, for us, for our children, etc. But I was reminded how Jesus gave so much encouragement to His disciples not to worry, specifically in the last half of Matthew 6.

Jesus took a lot of time to emphasize: don't worry, don't worry, don't worry! 3 times He gave the command; in the first of that section (25), the last verse (34), and in the middle in verse 31. And amidst all of that, He gave many VERY SPECIFIC reasons not to worry.

I believe that a word from the Lord at the right time is like wings - it allows us to rise above the problems at hand, even without removing them. And when I read what Jesus said here in Matthew 6 verse by verse, there's whole truckload of encouragement in there that can help us to fly (spiritually) and rise above worry, if we meditate on what Jesus said and obey it.

**1.** Starting from verse 25, the first reason Jesus gave not to worry:

*"Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"*

In other words: **The things we tend to worry about aren't what matter the most.**

Jesus was saying, don't worry, because the things we tend to worry about are not the most important things. God wants us to have PERSPECTIVE, to see things like He sees them - to consider, what’s really most valuable? That's worth worrying about the most.

We need food and clothing to life, but LIFE itself is so much more than food and clothing! Food, clothing, a roof over our head, a job to provide money for all these things, - they're all just a means to help us keep living life, they're not what life itself is all about! Sometimes focusing on these things and being anxious about them can blind us to what's really important.

Life is more than any physical need or concern - our eternal life with God forever, fellowship with Him where we are like Him unhindered by any sin, our name is written in Heaven, God loves us - that's far more important than any physical conern. If we could see the vast difference in the value and importance of physical concerns versus spiritual ones like God sees it, then worry would fade away.

A small quarter can block be blocking our view of the sun if we hold it close enough! In the same way, real life is a lot more than the small things on this earth.

Why don't we need to worry about the things of this life? The first reason Jesus gave is because the things here - EVERYTHING WE CAN SEE - those aren't the things that will matter when we soon leave this earth.

All the material things in this life are like a Monopoly game. We can be like kids kicking and screaming for the little houses and fake money, and nice clothes so we can win the game - But pretty soon it's all going to be folded up and put away.

The rich, the poor, the good looking, the average looking, the strong, the young, the old - for every single person alive on earth today - one day death will make everyone equal with regard to earthly things. The poor soon will have exactly the same amount of money as the rich, the ugliest person will be just as good looking as the best looking Hollywood star, and we'll be left with what was really important, what life was really about: How close were we to the Lord (Matt 7:23)? Are we pure like Him (1 John 3:3)? What did we live for? Is the treasure that we laid up for all our decades on earth eternal lasting, or are we leaving it behind? (Matt 6:19-20)

So that's the first reason I see Jesus said not to worry - put things in perspective.

**2.** The second reason I see that Jesus gave is in verse 26:

*"Your Heavenly Father feeds the birds"* -

Don't worry because: "God is a good Heavenly Father. And not only that but He's YOUR Father!! And not only that but He's so caring, that He cares even for little birds!

I notice that Jesus used in passing here the phrase "Your Heavenly Father"

I used to look at the sermon on the mount as a lot of very high commands. But one time I wondered - how did Jesus encourage? We've learned - encouragement and love is the main way God builds us up - the kindness of God leads us to repentance. Does that exist in the sermon on the mount?

But then I saw - Jesus gave the *best* encouragement, I'm sure none of those people ever heard from a preacher or pharisee or scribe before. The encouragement was: "God is your Heavenly Father."

We hear it so much, but I don't know if those people ever heard that before! I was blessed to imagine myself in the shoes of those people, hearing it for the first time.

Jesus was saying - "God isn't just some far off random God" He's your Dad!!! Even with all the high standards against sin that Jesus preached, Jesus was the greatest encourager. And I saw - that's how He did it - by emphasizing, God is your Dad.

By saying those three words "Your Heavenly Father", Jesus was saying much more. He was saying: **"You're not alone. You're cared for. You have a Father, He will take care of you. You have eternal hope, your Father loves you not just now but forever!"**

It's amazing to go through the sermon on the mount and see all the times Jesus used that phrase.

And then He said - this Heavenly Father is full of such love and mercy, that He cares even for birds!

There's an important reason why Jesus used such a picture of little birds: It means that He cares for every little detail of your life.

I was blessed by a paraphrase I heard of Matthew 10:29

Matthew 10:29 says *"Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father."*

The paraphrase of it I heard was: "God attends the funeral of every sparrow."

Can you imagine the humility and love God has to pay attention and give care for, in a sense - attending the funeral of every single sparrow that passes away? Taking notice of every random bird that dies in the forest that no person ever has seen or ever will see?

I believe God is like that - **nobody else may know or care for some little detail of your life, it's a hidden burden for you. But God is there, He shows up for it to help. Nobody else may show up, but God does.**

And that’s a reason not to worry.

**3.** In the next verse (27) we can see reason not to worry #3: *"And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?"*

Jesus' third reason not to worry was: Worrying doesn't do anything to help any situation. Worrying is a waste of time.

This doesn't mean that we shouldn't be concerned about anything, or that we shouldn't plan for the future. Being concerned and planning is different from worry. We should be concerned and plan for the future. For example, if my child is lost in a store - I should definitely be concerned! And take action. Another example is, it's wise to save for the future, for our retirement, etc as much as we are able (one piece of advice that's helped me is to setup a plan where I can "set it and forget it", I can have auto payments to put away savings and I don't have to look at it, so it can free up my mind to think about more important things).

But worrying is different. There's no end to worrying, there's no 'set it and forget it.' Worrying will constantly check the bank account, fearing it may drop.

Worrying is a long lasting panic about *tomorrow*, that consumes my mind and sucks out my thoughts from what really matters *today*.

Worrying is an inward panic that lasts until the problem is over, with no hope - it could be days or it could be years on end.

Recently there were some decisions being made at my work that would be decided on that could effect my job. I was tempted to dwell on them and think a lot about "well if this happens, then I can do this, and if that happens, then this... what if that happens?" And I felt the Lord put on my heart - I don't need to think about that yet, nothing may happen! If it does then I can cross that bridge when I get there.

POWER TO FORGET

So I got peace and I felt God give me strength not to think about it anymore. The Lord gave me the strength to cast it out of my mind.

He can do that - He gives us the strength to cast things out of our mind - it's a great power of the Holy Spirit to help us do that - to choose to not think about things, not be consumed about them. I've seen how He helps me do that with the strength of His Spirit.

I heard a saying, probably by an old wise man, who said, "I've suffered many things in my life - most of which never happend" Because he spent so much time worrying - he experienced the suffering for all these things that never happened, just as if they happened! What a waste!

Worrying doesn't do anything for us, but distracts us from what's really important.

FEARING A PLANE CRASH

I was on an airplane flight once, and in mid-air the plane started making some really weird loud sound, something I've never heard, and people were wondering 'what is that?' I know there's no promise in the Bible that my plane won't crash. So my mind started thinking, "What's that sound...?" I found comfort in this: JUST ASSUME THE BEST because God's a Dad that cares, I don't think God will allow me to get into a plane crash. And worrying about it wouldn't have done anything to help the plane not to crash! But let's say He did. There have been faithful Christians in plane crashes before. What if God lets my plane crash? I believe the comfort comes from His Word that He would turn that crash into such a good thing (eternally) that I'll look back after I die and say "Lord, your plan was perfect - I would choose the same thing." He does all things well (Mark 7:37).

## Reasons Not To Worry - Part 2
*Oct 12, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=187)] 

![](images/187.jpg)

*(This blog is part 2 of 2. The first blog is here):*

[Reasons not to worry (Part 1)](http://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=186)

**4.** The fourth reason I see that Jesus gave us not to worry is in verses v28-32

Matt 6:30 says *"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you?"*

God will automatically take care of our needs without us having to worry about it.

We heard about birds and how God cares, now we're hearing about things which God cares for **that can't even think** - plants! Things that don't think or move around like animals, and God still takes care of them!

How much more would God take care of me, without me having to push and plan and control things in order to meet my earthly needs?

Verse 32 says “Your Heavenly Father knows you need all these things”

I sometimes think of how my own earthly parents have had such a desire for my good, how they rooted for me to get a good job when I finished college, to marry well, to provide for my family, they desired for the good of my children. How much more does God know about and desire all these needs to be met for my family and I? Even moreso.

How much more does God care for us than the plants He clothes and feeds?

He'll provide automatically. This doesn't mean that He works on behalf of lazy people - we still have to work to live. If food is in front of us we still have to pick it up and chew and swallow it. But the Lord will make sure it's there for us. If we put the Lord first, we will always have what we need, our children will have what they need - the Lord will always provide.

George Muller was a godly saint who had a heart for orphan children. One day they were out of milk and food. Hundreds of kids sitting there hungry, and so what did George do? He had everyone pray and thank the Lord in faith for the food that wasn't there on the table yet. After they thanked the Lord, there was a knock on the door. A milk truck had broken down in front of their orphanage and the milk man offered to give it all to the kids, otherwise it would spoil! The Lord provided miraculously.

I've never experienced a miracle like that, but the fact that I've never lacked food even a day in my life doesn't mean I should be any less thankful or full of faith! The Lord is faithful, He always has provided my needs, and always will - even if it takes a miracle to do it. And that's the 4th reason not to worry.

**5.** Reason not to worry #5 which Jesus gave in Matthew 6:32-33 is one of the most critical reasons not to worry: Worrying about the things here distracts us from focusing on what's most important (The most important thing being (what the world misses): Seeking God Himself, and to be like Him).

Matthew 6:32-33 *"For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."*

If we seek first His kingdom and righteousness, God will automatically give us our earthly needs. What God's kingdom?

I heard a saying a sister in our church shared some years ago - regarding the question "what is the kingdom of God?" She said, "The kingdom of God is wherever God is king."

I was so blessed by that. In other words - seek to make God king of my life, king of my heart, the only one on the throne - my everything. Then the kingdom of God can be there! And wherever God is king - there's righteousness, peace and joy there (Rom 14:17) - no worry.

So if I'm seeking to keep God on the throne of my heart, that will be the most restful and peaceful life.

A DECEPTION

One deception I've fallen into many times is to think: The way to peace is to get rid of all my problems - "I just need to get to a point where I have no major problems in life, then I can have peace and not worry."

"If I just had a new boss, if my kids were older and better behaved, if my spouse was like this, if I could just move out of California where things are cheaper, and get a job where I could work from home, making this much more money a year, then I could go on a vacation as much as I want and order out all the food that I want so i don't have to cook, then I could hire some people to do my yard work and clean my house, never have to deal with money or house problems again... ahhhh that would be so nice, then I could have peace."

**That's one of the devil's biggest deceptions!** **"IF ONLY... such and such... then I could have peace."**

Even if we could accomplish every earthly ambition we wanted, there'd definitely be some other problems to worry about - because rest doesn't lie outside of us, it's something that is inside of us ("peace in the Holy Spirit"). The weather would be too hot, we'd go on vacation and get sick, the hotel would be too crowded... some new health issue comes up I need surgery for - something, anything would disturb me because I'm not at inward rest.

There's no finding rest *outside* in the flesh! Never.

Freedom from anxiousness comes only in one way: seeking God and His righteousness first - seeking His presence with us and making my life's focus to refine myself, to be like Him. Knowing Him and pleasing Him. Being intimate with Him and living to see His smile. Loving Him and fearing Him.

God will take care of all my earthly needs automatically so that I can focus on making Him king of my life.

A CLARIFICATION - IT'S PROGRESSIVE

We may not be where we want to be yet, we still think about a lot of earthly concerns, and have to keep directing our mind to focus on the Lord. But we can be encouraged that it's a progressive battle. We make progress in it over time as we fight, we get victory and slowly our mind starts to be transformed. The Bible doesn't say it's a one time transformation, but says to have a continual renewal of this transformation (Romans 12:2).

It's like a cup full of dirty water. Our mind is dirty from years and decades of past sinful and careless living, distant from God. And now we have to keep pouring in clean, pure water. The cup isn't clean instantly right when we pour in clean water (God's Word and promises/encouragements) but over time it'll get cleaner and cleaner as we pour in clean water, and we get more peace over time as the Lord helps us to transform our mind to focus on what's really important.

**6.** The last reason not to worry that Jesus gave is in verse 34:

*“Tomorrow will care for itself”*

The last reason not to worry about all the problems of the future that Jesus gave us, I read like this: God will give us the grace when we get there! I believe that's what "Tomorrow will care for itself" means. We can trust the Lord to give the power and supply for tomorrow that we need when we get there.

I used to think about how Abraham had such integrity, faith, and love for the Lord to be faithful to sacrifice his beloved Isaac. And I started worrying - do I have all that faith, to where if God called me to do something extreme (under end-time persecution, for example), I could do it? What if I face some really tough temptation? The Lord comforted me with that same thought - if tomorrow I run into that situation, then He will give me the grace for it. But don't worry about it today.

“So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:34‬ There’s enough today to focus on - seek the Lord for help for the things today. Tomorrow we can seek Him again for help.

I see that’s one way God keeps me close to Him - always giving needs that come up and drive me to go to Him. I’m thankful for that.

CONCLUSION

I just want to end with a related saying I've been blessed a lot by recently from Charles Spurgeon, it's a sort of a paraphrase or rewording of Romans 8:28.

He said;

*"If there was a better situation for you than the one you're in right now, DIVINE LOVE would have put you there already"*

Why am I in the situation I'm in? Is it bad luck? Coincidence? Is it punishment because of mistakes I made in the past? No. The reason I'm in the exact situation I am in today is because GOD INTENSELY LOVES ME! That's why we’re in the exact situation we’re in right now. That's why we live where we live, that's why we look like we do, that's why we were born the year we were, that's why we have the family we have, that's why we're married or not married to who we are, why we work in the occupation we're in, why we make the exact salary we do down to the dollar, everything! God's intense Divine Love has us exactly where we are today.

I'm seeing the Lord help me have more confidence in His love over time - not all at once, but OVER TIME He's helping me grow in it, and I trust Him to keep make it even more and more clear for me - to have that revelation of the knowledge of Him in my heart, confident, not shaken so easily like I used to be in all the worries and cares of life.

In summary, here are the reasons I see that Jesus gave for us not to worry:

1. The things we tend to worry about, aren't what matter the most

2. God is our Heavenly Father who loves us intensely and will care for us

3. Worrying does nothing to help our situation tomorrow, but drains our strength for the things we have to do today

4. God will provide our all needs without us having to push for them

5. Worrying about earthly things distracts us from what's most important

6. There's enough to lean on the Lord for regarding today's needs, we can trust Him to provide for tomorrow's needs when they come

May the Lord give us revelation of these things more in our heart, as we meditate on them.


# Chapter Sixty Five
## Be Free From Regret: God'S Plan Is Bigger Than Your Past
*Nov 23, 2020*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=190)] 

![](images/190.jpg)

Philippians 3:13 *"Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead"*

One of the deepest struggles a person can have is the discouragement that comes from regret. I believe the reason why it's so deep and difficult for many is because of one reason: the past is unchangeable. Anxiousness and fear can be dealt with in a sense - the Lord can give us hope for the future that whatever we fear or are anxious about will not happen. There's hope things can still work out. The future can be changed, but the past cannot. Whatever mistakes we've made in the past can never be unmade. Many things we left undone can never be done again. Whatever passed yesterday cannot be attained again. Yesterday is gone forever, and for many of our decisions - the possibility to change them is gone too. For many of them, we are now left to live with the consequenses of them, some for the rest of our lives.

Yes, regret can be one of the heaviest weights for a person, even a Christian can carry for their whole life because of that reason: the past is unchangeable. One example I've had in my life in past years is the regret of not spending more time, or talking more, or praying more for loved ones who've passed away. Sometimes when I've thought of them, the thought comes into my mind, "I wish... just one more day." But yesterday is gone, I can never get it back. When the Lord promises in Joel that He will make up for the years the locusts have eaten (Joel 2:25), how can he restore a field that's totally gone from my life?

I don't have all the answers, but the Lord has tremendously comforted me in the area of the discouragement of regret, and by His grace I can say He freed me from slavery to it. Not just in the instance of loved ones who have passed away, but many other things too. I just wanted to share one or two things that He spoke to me along the way that were words of life for me, that stayed with me to set me free.

A COMFORT FOR ME

One thing that's really comforted me deeply in the area of regret is this truth:

The Lord loves me, He is sovereign, and in His sovereignty and love He did not stop me from making my mistake. This means that He has in His Divine wisdom intentionally chosen to make my mistakes part of His plan for my life.

Here's a question: was Peter's denial of Jesus God's will? Definitely not. It was a deep sin. Jesus even went so far as to say once that whoever denies Him He will deny before the Father (Matt 10:33). It was a serious thing, and Peter knew it. How could he not carry regret and discouragement for his whole life after that?

But that's not the whole story. We also have to look at one other question: Was Peter's denial of Jesus part of God's plan? I believe we can say without a doubt, that it was not God's will, but God knew Peter would deny Him, and so He used it. Peter was so proud, and God had a great plan for Peter, but the only way to accomplish this was to break Peter's pride by allowing him to fall.

It’s very significant that Jesus did not pray for Peter not to fall, but He did pray that Peter’s faith wouldn’t fail (Luke 22:31-32). After that point, the always-confident Peter, when he preached at Pentecost and thousands of Jews were saved, he could remain humble because he carried a reminder with him of how unworthy he was on his own - he never forgot that fall of his. And for something so ugly (when you focus on that one terrible action of his), the Lord worked it so perfectly into the tapestry of Peter's life when you "Zoom out" to see the whole picture. Only the power of God can do something like that. God is such a Master at what He does that He can take an ugly piece of cloth, and sew it into the quilt of someone's life in such a way that the quilt is even more beautiful in the end than it would have been without it. Peter died beautifully humble, with the honor of being martyred for the Lord (he even requested to be crucified upside-down instead of right-side up because he felt unworthy to be killed like his Savior!).

To me, this tells me that - God will not stop me from making mistakes, even sins, if He needs to do it to accomplish His plan for my life. Maybe I need to be broken deeper than I thought, or maybe He will correct it in some miraculous way which I never would have imagined - but either way, He allowed it. He could have made Peter so sick that night of the betrayal, that he was bedridden and nowhere near being questioned by anybody. He could have let one of the soldiers hit Peter on the head when they arrested Jesus so that he would be knocked out for a few days - no denial by Peter, problem solved! He could have sent an angel to wake me up at 2AM the day of some mistake of mine to speak to me, "Bobby - God says do this" or "Bobby, at all cost, don't do this", and stopped me in my tracks, but He didn't. He allowed me to make the mistake. I should repent with all my heart of my sins, but I should never stop believing that God's eternal plan and purpose is ruined and irrecoverable. If He allowed it - that means that He has decided to include it into His plan for me, I need never ever look back in despair thinking, "Why did I do this, why didn't I do that? Everything is ruined forever because of me!"

If it would have derailed God’s eternal plan for my life, the Lord would have stopped me immediately. He will not let go so easy what He paid such a high price for.

THE CONSEQUENCES

It's true that my past may cause years or even decades of grief, sorrow, and difficulty for me in the future. This can magnify the temptation to give into regret and dwell in deep discouragement. What do we do in this case? If this is the case - I believe we can look at 2 Corinthians 12 for encouragement, and take these consequences like Paul looked at his thorn: "If God allowed this, I need this."

Paul said, "I need this thorn to keep me humble, from exalting myself" (2 Cor 12:7). Life may be difficult from here on out, but it need not be void of complete fullness of joy and rest, and a peace that passes understanding. In many ways, this can give us even more capacity for joy, because if we're carrying a deep physical or earthly burden it can help us from being deceived by the joy this world offers, and thinking that we really have the joy of the Lord when in fact we don't. If we have everything going perfectly for us, it’s very easy to be deceived that we are walking just fine with the Lord while all this time our spiritual life may be in shambles (Rev 3:17).

If you're struggling with regret, remember: there's a very, very important reason that the Lord did not prevent what you did (or neglected to do), and He may not show you the reason yet, or maybe never in this life. But there's a reason. Endure the consequences faithfully, being totally honest with Him about your past, and allow the Lord to lift you up above the storm of whatever consequences may come (Matt 14:30-31).

Going back to my struggle of wishing I could do differently with loved ones who've passed, my comfort is this: God loves them much more than I will ever love them. And what He has done in the past (so loved the world and sent Jesus that they may be saved - John 3:16) is infinitely more important than what I’ve done (or not done) in the past!

Anything which I should have done that I've missed, the Lord could have (and may have) worked that in some other way for this person I loved. Maybe even in the last seconds of their life, like the thief on the cross. He knows I loved them, and knew my heart the whole time - that the love itself I have for someone else is actually a manifestation of God’s heart and love for this person that I’m partaking of. We love because He first did (1 Jn 4:19). And I believe the Lord is such an intimate Father, even our whispering inward desires He can take as prayers. Comparing my life to driving a car on a road: I will look forward through the windshield with an ambition to do things totally differently in the future wanting to stay in God's perfect path for my life. But when I look backward through the rearview mirror, I'll repent honestly and whole-heartedly, and then praise the Lord for His mercy which covers all the times I missed His will, and for working those times into a great plan He has for me when I "Zoom out" to look at the entire picture eternally.

2 Cor 5:17 *"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come."*

Carrying regret does not glorify God. For us in Christ, the old things have passed away, even the ones yesterday. The day is new today. Be totally free from regret from today on, do not carry it even one more second. Instead, turn your regret into praise. Praise - that the Lord's plan is much, much bigger than your past.


# Chapter Sixty Six
## Encouragement Is The Best Gift
*Jan 16, 2021*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=195)] 

![](images/195.jpg)

*“Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭2:4‬ ‭NASB‬‬*

I've been challenged seeing how much the Bible emphasizes the fact that it's not harshness, it's not the law, it's not threats of punishment which bring a person to repentance, deliver them from sin and make them more like Jesus. It's God's kindness, His mercy and love, His gentleness which keep a person walking in the fear of the Lord. It's His encouragement that keeps me from becoming hard-hearted with sin (Heb 3:13).

I remember times when I would see screaming little kids at the store throwing tantrums, and I would be tempted to think, "What that boy needs is a belt on his bottom."

Although I don't de-value the Bible's exhortations to discipline children (Prov 22:15), I see now that's not our Father's main and preferred method with us, to make us like Jesus.

The Lord is very slow to anger, and doesn't deal with us as our sins deserve (Psalm 103:8-10). To recognize the Lord is that way with me has made me want to be the same toward others, to be easy on them, and repay them not with harshness but with kind and gentle words in return.

As a church we've been very familiar with Hebrews 3:13 in this regard (that encouragement keeps a person's heart from getting hard with sin), and I was blessed to see Job (who wrote before any Scripture existed on the whole face of the earth) say the same thing, regarding what keeps people in the fear of God and from sin:

*“For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend; So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.” ‭‭Job‬ ‭6:14‬ ‭NASB‬‬*

The despairing can be preserved, walking in the fear of God, if they have kindness and encouragement from a brother or sister in Jesus at the right time.

Encouragement is the best gift we can give someone else. Consider these 5 brief points about encouragement:

**1. Encouragement is free to give**

Many people search stores, shop online and spend money to try and show their love to others with material things. Encouragement (which is a much better gift that lasts for eternity) is totally free, and it's a lot more valuable! It can pass on an ETERNAL treasure to someone, which they keep forever... and it doesn't cost us a dime.

*“Don't hold back when you have it in your power to give" - Prov 3:27*

*Matthew 6:19-20 "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven"*

**2. You don't have to be a preacher**

It's helped me to remember that it doesn’t require a complicated, or spectacular new word or prepared sermon or even a lesson from the Bible to encourage someone. What I took from the message we heard from Brother Sandeep on Sunday was, that even our physical presence (being there) can encourage someone and comfort them. Jesus said that God is Spirit, but we can be showing God’s love “in the flesh”, like it says that Jesus was God's Word made flesh (John 1:14). We may not know what to say, but at the minimum, can I just start by BEING THERE with someone? Anyone can do that. The Lord has given us two ears and one mouth, and I believe He wants to show, that to be present and simply listen is the first priority. To listen with sympathy and compassion is one of the greatest acts of love. "Be quick to listen, slow to speak" (James 1:19).

One thing that’s come back to my mind a lot recently was that when Paul was despairing, he said that God comforted him by the “coming” of Titus, not the “words of Titus”. (2 Cor 7:6)

That’s very freeing to see that even when we don’t have the right words, the Lord can still use us, if we’re just available. As someone has said, "80% of life is just showing up."

**3. Encouragement can keep on giving for years, even after we’re gone**

I remember people who took time with me that helped to lift me up at very critical times. I remember a time where someone shared a simple word of encouragement with me when I was a child, and those words have stuck with me for almost 30 years now! A word of encouragement we give today can keep on giving for a person's whole life!

A dear Sister my wife and I know passed away some time ago, and we recently found a couple of cards and notes she had written to us over the years. They were FRESH encouragements for us that touched our hearts, lifted us up, and challenged us seeing that that's what she left behind. She's resting from her labors here, but her deeds are still here doing God's work in the path that she left:

*Revelation 14:13 "And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them."*

**4. Encouragement can be done in everyday, personal conversations**

The Bible teaches us that every one of us should encourage (1 Corinthians 14:39 "my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy"), and we should each desire that gift. But most people are not standing in front of dozens or hundreds of people regularly to speak to them. Most individuals in the church speak to one or two people at a time. To me, this tells me that since the Lord uses every person in the church, MOST of the church is built up regularly not just from what is heard on Sundays, but from what they hear everyday - from the one on one conversations with a brother or sister in the church, from their spouse, children from their parents, etc.

Some of the most powerful things to challenge and encourage a person press on to Jesus are simple prophetic words in one on one conversation. I've been the recipient of some life changing words, that have radically brought me closer to Jesus. And many of them have not been in sermons, but one on one conversations. Don't despise the one-on-one conversations you have, writing them off as just valueless "catch up" sessions. We don't need to be speaking to thousands of people at a time to build the church in the most powerful ways.

*Proverbs 25:11 "Like apples of gold in settings of silver Is a word spoken in right circumstances."*

**5. An enouragement doesn't have to be long or fancy**

I've been blessed so many times by someone sharing a verse and saying 4 simple words, ‘This verse blessed me’. To pass along a verse, and how it changed a life is one of the greatest encouragements. It reminds me of the blind man that Jesus healed. He told people "I don't know whether Jesus is a sinner, but I'm blind and now I see" (John 9:25). Today, unlike the blind man, we clearly know that Jesus was totally sinless. But like the blind man, there's still a lot we don't know - a lot of answers we don't have. But we can still share the testimony of power that God helped us with in so many situations where "I was blind, and now I see. I was lost and then God found me when He spoke this to my heart. I was despairing and then He lifted me."

Remember this: Most of prophecy is simply sharing of some problem I had, and how God helped me through it.

The word of power doesn't come from study only, but life with God. The blind man's testimony of "I was blind, now I see" was a million times more powerful (and also a million times more simple!) than him trying to explain Bible doctrines to the Pharisees.

CONCLUSION

With these in mind, I look back on my life with wonder that I haven’t poured into other people more with this free, easy, and simple gift which I can give to others - encouragement. But by God's grace I'm challenged to do better in 2021, especially at home with family during all this extra time we are having this season.


# Chapter Sixty Seven
## Have A Hope For Others
*Feb 3, 2021*

![](images/196.jpg)

1 Corinthians 13:7, speaking of love, says that Love *"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."*

We've recently heard some important truths about love from 1 Corinthians 13. I've been greatly challenged in this regard during this season where we're spending much time at home, that love for our near and dear ones right now during Covid is spelled like this: P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E, as our Brother Wenhai shared a couple of weeks back. This verse also emphasizes the same: love bears all things (patience) and endures all things (patience!)

And in verse 7 of this chapter, it also says that love "Hopes all things". That characteristic of love is not a truth I've meditated much on in the past, but I believe the Lord has given me some more understanding of recently what it means.

I remember praying over the years during different instances when people would be consistently acting harshly toward me, praying something to this effect: “Lord, bring them to repentance.”

The most recent times I've done that, perhaps over the past year or so, I couldn’t tell what the reason was, but I haven't had a total peace as I prayed that. I felt that it was the right prayer for them and I was confident that’s what they needed - to be convicted of their sin, to see it and repent.

But recently the Lord spoke to my heart what the issue was with that, why I didn’t have a peace - why my prayer was not right. He showed me something about myself. It was not that the words were wrong, but there were a few major problems with my MOTIVE as I prayed it:

1. I was praying with a selfish motive. My desire was that they’d repent, but it wasn't mainly for their good or for God’s glory, but it was because I felt that their sin was hurting me. I was basically just airing my frustration with these people toward God hoping He'd do something to intervene.

I wasn’t praying primarily ‘Lord, your kingdom come, your will be done’ to the Lord, I was praying mainly for ‘my’ kingdom.

When I saw the selfishness of that, I saw that there was a lack of love in myself toward others, and also a dull heart toward the Lord and His kingdom. The new covenant is much more about motive and attitude than about accuracy of our words. And selfishness is just as evident in prayer as it is in other areas.

I was challenged by Moses' heart when I saw this prayer of Moses to God:

*For if you destroy them, the Egyptians will say, “It is because the Lord wasn’t able to bring them to the land he promised them,” or “He destroyed them because he hated them: he brought them into the wilderness to slay them.”* Deuteronomy 9:28

When Moses prayed for God to preserve Israel, his motive wasn't even mainly Israel's good, it was primarily God’s glory. What an example Moses was of the fear of God and love for the Lord! I want such love for God that His glory would be my driving motive and ambition like that. When I saw that of Moses it renewed the challenge for me to go that same direction, to have God's glory at the center of my hope.

2. Secondly, I saw that I should never focus on a negative aspect, or a lack in someone without also having a hope for them. I should never judge anyone without also having a hope for their good.

A Christ-like heart is one full of hope for God's good first, and then a hope for the good of others. When I prayed that the Lord would bring others to repentance, I didn’t really have their good in mind. I had my good in mind, but "love hopes all things" - love hopes for the eternal good of the other person.

When I prayed before for others to repent, I wasn’t thinking of joyful thoughts of them being freed from sins and closer to Jesus, it didn’t cross my mind. I just wanted them to stop what they were doing!

One specific instance when I was praying this for someone, the Lord reminded me of some years earlier when this person I was thinking of had helped me and encouraged me in some very significant ways. I realized how much I was blessed some years earlier by this person, and I told the Lord, “Please forgive me Lord, I owe this person a lot.” When I repented of that, it changed my heart toward them and then I could freely seek the Lord for their good again. This time though, I really did have a real hope for their good. No matter who the person is, there's always something to appreciate about them. To focus on that instead of the negatives can help us have a hope for them, because that's exactly what the Lord does for us.

*Proverbs 19:11 "A man's discretion makes him slow to anger, And **it is his glory to overlook a transgression**."*

3. One last thing the Lord showed me as I prayed this:

“You don’t know all the details.”

Some of what I have felt I've seen of sin in others, have only been facts that I was assuming, and some of it I had actually not experienced firsthand myself but I heard second-hand from someone else. And the Lord reminded me, that I have to be very, very careful about assuming I know the the spiritual state of someone merely based on "what my eyes see", and "what my ears hear." I was reminded that I’ve been given so much, and that it’s only by the grace of God if I may not have some specific struggle that some other person has (1 Cor 4:7). But I don’t see what struggles others have had in their private life, I don’t see their motives or the reasons why they may do certain things, I don't see their secret sufferings or what they haven't been given which God has freely given me.

A disciple of Jesus should beware of believing and hearing gossip, and also assume the best about others.

One word I read in CFC's recent "Word for the week" which I believe is related has stuck with me: *"Discernment is a Divine quality, but suspicion is a Satanic quality."*

Love isn't always suspecting evil, assuming the worst about people. We should discern, but without love and a hope for another, it's not discernment, it's a spirit of suspicion, and tends to assume bad about others. I'm seeing that the heart of God always has a joy at the thought of good for others. If we desire God's judgment to come on what we perceive as sinful people because of what we see as evil in them (whether difficult relatives, or corrupt politicians, or ungodly coworkers, etc), I believe to that Jesus would say, "You don't know what kind of spirit you are of" (Luke 9:55, 2 Pet 3:9).

So to sum up, I’m taking with me these 3 lessons:

1. Pray with God’s kingdom in mind first and also the good of others, not my own selfish motives.

2. Never focus on or judge a lack in someone without also having a genuine hope for them.

3. I don’t know all the details, be careful what I assume about others. I’ve been given so much, don’t look down on anyone, I have no idea what their struggles are in private.

I’m thankful the Lord has used these words of conviction He spoke to my heart in order to help me cleanse my inner character of some bad unChristlike things toward others, praise God.


# Chapter Sixty Eight
## If You Had Lived 2000 Years Ago, What Kind Of Disciple Of Jesus Would You Have Been?
*Mar 19, 2021*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=198)] 

![](images/198.jpg)

Imagine if you were alive 2000 years ago, in Jesus' time, in Israel. Imagine God chose that life for you instead of living in 2021, but imagine still knowing all that you know now. What would you do, how would you live?

Would you join Jesus as a disciple? Would you seek Him all over Israel until you found Him, so you could be with Him?

Maybe you would go find John the Baptist and wait eagerly for Him to come?

Would you follow Jesus wherever He goes? (Matt 4:19-20)

Would you be the one disciple full of faith who humbly listened and accepted and did whatever He says, without objecting - every single little word? (Matt 16:21-23, John 6:68)

If He wakes up early and goes out of the house to be alone with the Father for a little time before everyone else gets up, would you wake up too? (Mark 1:35, Matthew 13:1)

If Jesus was washing dishes and cleaning the toilet in His home would you join Him?

If Jesus skipped a meal for the sake of fasting, would you also skip a meal even if it meant being hungry? (John 4:8, 32)

When food was low, would you be the one who encouraged the other disciples that Jesus would do something to provide?

Would you be the one in the boat during the storm who didn't panic with worry because Jesus is there? (Mark 4:37-38)

Would you serve Him and wash His feet? Would you bend down and join with Him, with a towel of your own to join Him when He washed the feet of the other disciples? (John 13:14)

When Jesus tells little children to come and spent time with them instead of pushing them away, would you also take time with them, even if it meant interrupting your own adult plans? (Matthew 19:14)

Would you stay up late with Him praying in Gethsemane, even when you're tired? (Matt 26:40-41)

Would you be willingly taken with Him from Gethsemane to stand trial even if it meant your death?

Would you contently receive accusations of lies and blame, while remaining quiet? (Mark 14:61)

Would you remain a humble servant, not like Peter so confident and outspoken but quiet until He gives you direction - like the angels do? (Rev 7:11)

Would you help bear the load of the cross with Him as He went to Calvary? (Matt 16:24, Matt 11:29)

Would you after He died, unlike Thomas, be full of faith, eagerly waiting outside of the tomb for 3 days until He comes out? (John 20:27)

Would you leave everything to follow Jesus, surrendering all ambition for this life, forsaking your possessions, yourself and even your own family for the sake of doing whatever Jesus wants you to do? (Luke 14:26-33)

Would you count your whole life as loss for the sake of being a disciple who has no other purpose than to love and be with and obey Jesus? (Php 3:8)

The most stirring thing about these questions when I recognize this: I can do all of this TODAY, if I love Jesus. (2 Cor 6:2). I don't need to go back in time 2000 years to love Jesus and walk with Him and live for Him, that isn't such a glamorous thing like it sounds. Because I can follow Jesus TODAY in whatever life I'm in this very day.

I can forsake all for Jesus.

I can wait for Him to come when I don’t know where He is, I can seek His presence until I find Him.

I can follow Him wherever He goes.

I can obey every little word He speaks to me, to not sin.

I can remain quiet about my own will until He guides me.

I can be full of faith and free from panic and anxiousness because the Lord is with me.

I can follow this Spirit’s whispers and leadings - to go or not go, to eat or not eat, to stop what I’m doing and do something else, or focus on something specific.

I can walk with Him with no fear of men even if it means danger to myself.

I can stay up praying with Him if He’s also up with a burden, I can get up early with Him to have time alone with the Father.

I can bend down with Him to wash the feet of the disciples when He’s doing the same.

I can receive a strike on the face with Him while remaining quiet.

I can carry my cross which was really His cross first.

It's very easy to imagine that if we lived in Jesus' time, we would be "all in", that we would be the one disciple who was full of faith and didn't doubt, wouldn't disobey, never left Jesus' side. But if I look at how I live today, that gives me a real perspective on just how "all in" I would be - the proof that I would be a disciple like that and humbly serve and love Him even to death if I was alive 2000 years ago is that I am a disciple TODAY, and humbly serve and love Him TODAY with all my heart, and put myself to death on the cross everyday, counting all else as loss and Him as everything. This has been challenging for me and helped me see what a privilege it is to be walking with Jesus today.

It’s very rare for Jesus to find obedient, quiet, humble, loving, devoted disciples who walk with Him like this. He didn't have any totally like that while He walked on the earth for a few years, but He has had many since then as the Holy Spirit has come to help now and give us the grace (God's power to do His will) to live such a life. And my ambition is to be one of them. I have faith that with the help of the Holy Spirit He can help me walk this type of life.


# Chapter Sixty Nine
## Pray And Don'T Lose Heart
*May 23, 2021*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=203)] 

![](images/203.jpg)

Jesus told His disciples in Luke 18:1 - *"...they ought to pray and not to lose heart"*

He went on to tell the parable of the persistent widow, who persuaded a judge to take action for her by constantly coming to him until he did something for her. And He said,

*"Now, will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them? I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?" (Luke 18:7-8)*

In the past month or so, the Lord has really gripped my heart with this exhortation that Jesus gave.

In our church we've often heard Brother Zac say to parents to pray for our kids consistently, regularly.

I have tried to do that with my wife and I see that prayer is like a leash that won't let them stray too far, it is a protection. At the end of everything - when my kids get older and move on from our home, we will have made many mistakes looking back in raising our children, but can I at least be able to say that we prayed for them consistently? That will be enough to cover all of our sins and lack and mistakes we made along the way.

I see the effect of the prayers others including my parents have had for me in my own life, and I'm convinced of the Lord's faithfulness to answer my own when I pray for my children. I will set myself to pray for them and not lose heart or stop until they are born again, and to pray they will be disciples.

But one day this thought came to me which I’m convinced was a conviction from the Lord - the same faith which I am having to pray for my children, with persistence regularly and consistently; can I not pray for other important things in the same way? Especially against my sin and UnChristlikeness which I see lingering on in me?

For example - if there's sin I've seen in my heart; some ongoing impatience, some root of bitterness toward someone, or subtle love of money where I give into some covetous thoughts for it, some slavery to food or addiction to electronics (like my phone), or some selfishness, some laziness, some spiritual dryness and lack of love for the Lord - can I set myself to pray consistently for deliverance until God helps me?

I have enough faith and burden for the salvation of my children, is not my own salvation from my sins (being saved from sin which is present in me today) equally as important, and deserve persistent prayer, until even the end of my life if needed?!

That thought has totally gripped me and changed my prayer life recently - if I pray and don't stop, the Lord will definitely answer.

These prayers can also be for others. Some sin or slavery in someone else that I see, and I have a burden to see them delivered from.

I often remember how Hudson Taylor said, "I've learned to move man by prayer alone." Can I not seek the Lord persistently to move in another person's heart? My lost loved one, my coworker? My brother who's struggling with some sin, slavery, discouragement or guilt? We can knock persistently for bread for others - the Lord will also answer!! Jesus told the same parable in this regard for others in the parable of the friend at midnight (Luke 11:5-8)!

Maybe there’s something I need someone else to be moved for, for the sake of my family. Suppose my child's school lost my child’s paperwork needed to enroll him, and he’s in danger of losing his spot and being moved to the wrong school. Complaining is a sin, and it won’t do anything. Instead, can I “move man by prayer alone?” The bank made a mistake and overcharged by a lot of money, money that my family and I need, and I can’t seem to get through to the right person. Can I move man by prayer alone? Praying until God helps?

I believe the Lord loves to see such faith where we lean on Him, and don’t leave Him. Because faith is the thing that pleases God (Hebrews 11:6).

The world, when it's offered things freely (food, money, discount on material things, etc) crowds around the supply like ants until it's all gone! There’s this thing in the U.S. called “Black Friday” where things are sold for huge discounts at many stores all over the country. Millions of people get up really early in the morning once a year to save a couple or few hundred dollars. Some even camp in tents the night before. Isn't it a wonder that the children of God don't storm God's throne with boldness like that for the things He's offering? It's because of what Jesus said in verse 8 - there's no faith.

*"When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith [the faith proved by persistence and not stopping until something is gained] like this?"*

I heard someone once say, “The angels must be shocked at the mountain of blessings, just sitting there in Heaven, left unredeemed by God’s children, simply because they didn’t come and ask.”

On the same note, there must be so much joy in Heaven where some rare one prays and doesn’t give up, and makes it through to that treasure to take of it. And the angels say, “Finally!!!! Someone who sees the vast eternal value in what the Lord has to give!!”

And these people may not appear zealous or excited on the outside. It may just be their personality. Real zeal isn’t necessarily shown by a persons personality and emotions. Real zeal and faith is proven by persistence.

It’s possible we can think we asked, having not really asked. We pray once or twice (maybe even with tears) for something and we see nothing happen, and figure "Well that didn't work, I guess I'll move on.” That’s not asking. And that’s not faith. It doesn’t matter how many tears there were in those 2 prayers. The prayers *stopped*; that's the proof it wasn't a real burden or faith.

Faith also means burden. Burden to where, we will pray until the day we die if we have to for God to do something. Real faith and burden means never stopping.

And we can get discouraged when God doesn't answer, and wonder why - all the time not realizing that, the reason He is delaying is because He's doing a lot more than just answering what we're praying for. His ways are so much higher than ours (Isaiah 55:9). He doesn't only want to change our situation through our prayer, He wants to change US.

Prayer doesn't just change our situation it changes us!

The Lord has changed my life recently through this word of Jesus, and I'm so thankful He's given me a confidence in this parable of the persistent widow, that if we pray and do not lose heart, in due time we will break through and take freely from the spiritual mountain of treasure He has for us, if we only have the faith of persistence.

Whatever sin you’ve struggled with, whatever inward struggle you’ve had - lack of joy, slavery to anger or lust, anxiousness, fear, lukewarmness toward the Lord - whatever burden you have for another, whatever foothold Satan has had in your home or your marriage, whatever unmet need is left in your life or in your home -

Grab ahold of Luke 18 today and the Lord’s promise - break through (as long as it takes) to the treasure that God has freely for you, “pray and don’t lose heart.” Pray everyday, even a couple of minutes for these things - the main thing is just pray with burden from your heart in those 2 minutes, and pray regularly, daily - and don't stop. Even if it takes years or decades! He will answer, and even more importantly, He will be glorified and pleased by your persistent faith.


# Chapter Seventy
## Give God Room To Work
*Oct 4, 2021*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=207)] 

![](images/207.jpg)

In our Friday meeting a couple of years ago, a brother shared a quote which has stuck with me, and I've been blessed by it since: "Give God room to work".

Notice in John 6 what happened immediately after Jesus fed the multitude: *John 6:12-15 When they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost." So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world." So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.*

The people wanted to make Jesus king. Is that a good thing? I hope Jesus will be King in my life! It sounds like a great thing. But it was BY FORCE - they were trying to force God to make Jesus their king in THEIR own way.

Is it God's will for Jesus to be King of my life? Definitely. But these people were filled with all their own ideas about HOW THEY were going to accomplish God's will, in their own power, and what type of king Jesus would be.

They weren't submitting to God's timing for it, or His method for it.

And I've seen - when I'm lacking in faith, or holding onto something tightly, then I can be temped to try to force God's hand when it's not there. Pushing things before the time, or not giving Him room to work in His way.

But Jesus would never push, He submitted not only to God's will but God's timing and method too.

I was blessed by what a brother shared in our Friday meeting some time back about how someone at his work was blaming him for some big issue that was going wrong. His coworker emailed him accusing him of causing a big problem, and with their coworkers and bosses CC'd on the email so everyone would see it. So he emailed his coworker back privately and said, "No it's not like that, that's not the issue..." and continued to explain the details of the issue and what the real problem was. But again the coworker kept coming back to him sending emails and blaming him for this thing going wrong, accusing him that the problem was on his side. Instead of continuing to reply to this difficult coworker, this brother felt the Lord speak a word to him: 'GIVE ME ROOM TO WORK'.

So he stopped emailing and responding to his coworker, he just stayed quiet - not defending himself or anything. He would let God work. After some time this coworker discovered that it was indeed his own fault, and he came back and apologized saying, "Hey - I'm sorry, I was wrong. I discovered that you were right. The problem was from my side." The problem was solved without this brother having to fight with this coworker. He simply stayed quiet, and gave God time and room to work.

And I was challenged by that thought 'Give God room to work'. Am I giving the Lord room to work, or am I praying (with a pretense of faith) while at the same time still forcing His hand in something?

It's easy to prevent the Lord from working in our life by keeping a very tight grip on things, having ideas about what God's will is and how we'll accomplish it - trying to "Help" God's hand. But very often, the Lord wants our side of the job to be simply to "cease striving, and trust" (Psalm 46:10). Give Him room and time to work.

For a lot of situations in my life, I've prayed and at the same time tried to think of methods to solve my problems, and while not saying it I've tried to push His hand in my own way. But then after all my methods failed, I've found myself in a spot, where I said, "I've failed. Ok Lord, you have to do something. I recognize now that all my efforts are futile, I'm powerless and you want me to lean on you. I resign myself - you have to do the work."

Imagine some difficult problem you have and you've been fighting and not seeing the fruit yet. One encouragement you can take is: being desperately at the end of yourself is a good place to be! It's because now God has room to work. That's when we can learn to pray. Not just to pray, but to REALLY pray! Where we're not praying with a "plan B" (a backup plan we have in mind if God fails us) anymore.

It's such a restful place to be!

Give God room to work and give Him time to work.

*Isaiah 40:31 (AMP) "Those who wait for the Lord [who expect, look for, and hope in Him] Will gain new strength..."*


# Chapter Seventy One
## A Rescue Story: Stay Low, Keep Calm, And Press On
*Nov 17, 2021*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=210)] 

![](images/210.jpg)

**INTRO**

I remember our Brother Sandeep a while back used a phrase which stuck with me, he said something to the effect of (I'm paraphrasing): "The spiritual ones who make progress are the ones who: stay low, keep calm, and press on."

It reminded me that my mission as a Christian soldier is to maintain a laser-focus on my main calling: devotion to Jesus (2 Cor 11:3), to seek His kingdom and His righteousness (Matt 6:33), without getting distracted with all attractions, burdens, problems, and fights, of this lower passing world.

*“No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.” 2 Timothy‬ ‭2:4‬*

If a Christian will succeed at the highest goal and make their life of any eternal value, he or she must in humility die to many things, not get stirred up by unimportant things, and in faith and hope must slowly, patiently press into the kingdom.

That phrase stayed with me, and from that phrase the Lord laid a picture-story on my heart of a group of soldiers on a mission who follow that way.

**A Rescue Story: Stay Low, Keep Calm, and Press On**

There was once a city called “Christianland.” It was wasn't the largest city in the land, but it *was* the most powerful kingdom, and it was ruled by a mighty, compassionate King. It sat right next to a vast neighboring enemy city, a very attractive, but dangerous one called “Worldlyland.”

10 of the citizens of Christianland decided to take a trip there into Worldlyland to explore, experience and see some of the sites they had heard about (massive architecture, beautiful lights, spectacular buildings, delightful music), and they stayed many days there - longer than they had originally planned. One evening, while they were out exploring late, as they were getting tired and weak, they were all taken captive by a hostile street gang. The gang did not have any intention of returning these folks back to Christianland. Their goal was to keep them and brainwash them so they themselves would not want to go back to Christianland. They didn't want just their money - they wanted THEM. There was no negotiation. They hid them in a large upper room of their complex, which was tucked away in the heart - in the very center of Worldlyland.

Back at home, when it became clear that these 10 were missing, and had not returned home for many days, the King of Christianland sent a group of 12 soldiers into Worldlyland to go rescue its captive citizens. As He sent them off, He promised He would be with them even from afar, and that they would succeed in their mission if they obeyed what He told them. He then spoke one final departing word to them: **"Stay low, Keep calm, and Press on."**

They left the King, and prepared to depart together. As they prepared, one of the soldiers stood up and said, “Let us go in secretly, keep our heads down, and stay quiet with as little interaction there as possible. We’ll disguise ourselves, pinpoint the location of our brothers and sisters, and quietly lead them out. This is the King's way.” One other solider said, “Why should we have to do that? We’re in the right, we have huge weapons, and we are the most powerful kingdom in the world. We will go in fully armed and attack anybody who stands in our way or tries to hinder our mission."

Five of the soldiers agreed with the first (they wanted to do things the way exactly as the King instructed), and five agreed with the other. So the soldiers split into 2 units of 6 soldiers each: one group was called the "Zealots Unit", and the other group, which would obey and follow the way the King said to do it was called the "Meek Unit."

So the two units proceeded separately to Worldlyland with the same goal, but with very different strategies.

They all journeyed over, and immediately upon approaching the front gates, the Zealots busted into the city with force. Almost immediately they were involved in a fierce battle and spent the whole first day in a ditch, trying to advance while being held off by much attack. There was a lot of noise - clashing of weapons and metal, fiery arrows flying, yelling, arguing across the street and fighting with the evil Worldlyland soldiers.

Meanwhile the Meek unit went around and snuck into the back gate of the city, dressed in regular clothes. The leader of the Meek team kept saying to his unit: "Stay Low, Keep Calm and Press On." They did not have time or ambition for a fight with all those in Worldlyland, the gang was the real enemy, and their mission was one of rescue, not one of fighting the people of the city. In fact they didn’t even bring weapons, except for two hidden swords among all of them in order to defend themselves in case the need arose. But they had no desire or intention to use them.

The Zealot Unit was stuck, making no progress. Some wanted to return to Christianland, but the pressure was rising. They were not accomplishing anything, even after much time fighting.

The Meek proceeded through the back of Worldlyland with as little interaction with the people there as possible. They asked some random, average Worldlylandians some questions, to try to get some hint as to where their brothers and sisters might be. At one point a group of Worldlyland soldiers noticed them. As they approached from a distance, the leader of the Meek unit reminded the team with a whisper, "Stay low, keep calm, and press on."

So the Worldlyland soldiers came up to them and demanded to know who they were. The team explained that they were not from this country, they are from another kingdom, but they did not give too many details. The soldiers became increasingly angry, yet the Meek team refused to argue with them or reveal too much, and they returned many hostile words with gentle ones. The soldiers and some hateful citizens tried to force them to join their people for their large city-wide party, (for the way that one makes peace with Worldlyland and the citizens of Worldlyland is to join the ongoing party which never stops there, it is their most important tradition). Yet the Meek refused, they knew the evil that happened there and the change that happens to people when someone surrenders over and decides to attend that party.

So they were beaten right there in an alleyway, with those Worldlyland citizens nearby joining in with the evil soldiers. The Meek didn’t return any reviling and they didn’t attack or fight in return. As all 6 of them laid on the ground being beaten, the team leader reiterated with a whisper of encouragement, "Stay low, keep calm and press on." In other words: they would resist the temptation of the party, endure the suffering, and continue on. The hostiles eventually left the Meek soldiers there lying in the street, bruised and bloody.

After everybody left, the Meek soldiers got up. They tended to each other, and comforted and encouraged each other as they set out to continue looking for the missing Christianland brothers and sisters; "Stay low, keep calm, and press on." One fellow and his wife who lived in Worldlyland saw all of this from a distance. They were so impressed by the conduct of these soldiers, and their hearts were so pierced at how different their own lives looked, that they followed them from a distance for a little while and upon continuing to see how different the character was from themselves and all these citizens of this other country, they couldn't hold back from approaching them and insisting that they wanted to join them. With all of the pleasure and lights and colors of Worldlyland, they now saw it for what it was - evil. They desired a better kingdom, one where righteousness, love, joy and peace dwell.

And the Meek Christianland soldiers were glad to let them join. The couple asked the team how they were so different, and what they were doing there. They said, "We are from Christianland, and our King saved our lives, and built a heavenly kingdom, and is helping us to live like this, as He is. And we now live for Him - the One who reigns in righteousness and rules with justice. And everybody who chooses to love the King and wants to live in righteousness, holiness and mercy like Him can enter." The couple was so filled with joy, they left everything, all of their possessions and family behind to join this group of Meek Christianland soldiers. They then proceeded to share with them all they knew about the kidnapping of the sojourners from Christianland. They knew where in the city the gang generally stayed, and after some days, as they continued walking through and searching the city, they finally noticed what was a short red-colored piece of rope hanging out of the high window on a building, 3 floors up. They knew - it was a sign from their fellows citizens of Christianland - "We are here, we need help, and we have faith our King will rescue us."

Meanwhile the Zealot unit was still fighting and so far they advanced only to a ditch 2 blocks ahead from where they started. They were continuing to be embroiled in the fighting, and they lost a couple soldiers of their team as these 2 were so tired of fighting, and so attracted to the surrounding sites and the deceiving promise of rest, that they laid down their weapons and suits in surrender and decided to join the citizens of Worldlyland, instead of continue on. So the team lost 2, as the other 4 continued to be distracted by much useless battle.

The Meek unit in the late evening crept up outside of the building where the captives were being held, and they threw up to the window the end of a long rope that they had found, that also happened to be the same color of red which the captive's short signal rope hanging from the window was. A red rope was their cry for help, and a red rope was now their salvation.

In the middle of pitch black night, each captive was lowered down the long red rope and in the dark of night the Meek team led them all out of the city, to return quietly to Christianland with all captives, and with the two from Worldlyland who joined them.

As they were heading back on the road they glimpsed from a distance the remaining 4 of the Zealot unit hiding in some bushes. They signaled to them that they had succeeded and were finally heading back. So the Zealot unit was able to soon also sneak off as they followed shortly after.

The Meek were tired and bruised, but glad that their mission and pilgrimage through Worldlyland was over, and they were full of so much joy that what hurt intensely before (their wounds), they did not feel the pain of anymore - similar to how a woman has a baby and does not feel the pain because of the joy she has when her child comes into the world. As they entered through the large gates of Christianland the next day upon their return, their bruises (from when they patiently endured suffering and being persecuted for not joining the Worldlyland party) were a banner, an "honor-badge" for them. It was a reminder of love, dedication to their King and to the people, as a price they contently paid to show their love to the King and to bring the captives back. The kingdom celebrated and the King was very proud.

Shortly behind, what was left of the Zealot team followed, and they were received back in, with merciful arms - though the joy and celebration was not the same. Then there was sadness and regret upon seeing that they had lost part of their team to Worldlyland.

Upon seeing all the people again, and the huge celebration, the Meek team had glowing smiles on their faces out of gladness. They then looked over at the King who had an even larger smile of joy as He was lovingly gazing at them. His joy was not in the decorations or the celebration, but in the Meek team themselves. He himself had sacrificed unspeakable things to build His Kingdom with these brothers and sisters of His, long ago He sacrificed many things which no one will ever understand. But now He was full of unspeakable joy - more than anyone else - to see that His brothers and sisters also partook of the same type of suffering and sacrifice for love of Him, and for love of others, and they shared in His same spirit as they brought back the captives.

Someone from the crowd, asked one of the Meek Unit members "How did you do it?" A sister from the Meek Unit said - we stayed low (with humility), we kept calm (with faith in the King to overcome our fears), and we pressed on without getting distracted by the attractions and wars and problems in the evil Worldlyland.

They celebrated together, and many from Christianland decided they wanted to also be strong and humble like the Meek soldiers and like the King, and so they trained from then on to be just like that. Nobody wanted to join the Zealot unit after that seeing how all of their fighting with hostile weapons from fear and hostility accomplished ZERO for the Christianland kingdom.

They now understood what real strength was. It was humility and meekness. They also wanted to attract as many from Worldlyland as they could to come to Christianland (as the couple did) since one day very soon, the King revealed that Worldlyland would be destroyed forever. But Christianland, and all who are in it because of the King have eternal life and will last forever there with him, just as He lives forever.

The end.

**CONCLUSION**

Humility and meekness are the real strength in the Kingdom of God and Christ. Those who spend their days on this earth distracted with "self" - laboring for self, and in pride - fighting, arguing, criticizing and judging, and looking down on the world or on other Christian denominations which don’t believe the same way, accomplish zero for His kingdom, and will regret it in the end.

Living for the Lord in all humility and meekness is the real powerful life, and the only way to fight the war against Satan and the kingdom of darkness while on this earth. "Stay low, keep calm, and press on." It's the strength to not be deterred or distracted by anything of this world, not the arguments, not the people not the attraction. Not the persecution, and not distracted by all the problems and pain/suffering in this passing world. To be single minded for the Lord, the King; that is real strength.

The godly will in all meekness “stay low, keep calm and press on.”

They will stay low - with no desire to do things their own way, to get attention and prove themselves great. In obedience to the King, and in humility they will not fight the world, defend themselves, or prove themselves right. They accept any difficult mission with submissiveness, according to the King's will.

They will keep calm - They have a King who is mighty, and will save them if any trouble arises. By the king they overcome all fear.

They will press on - difficulty and temptation will come, but they are strong and overcome because of the confidence and hope they have in the King and in the promises He has given, and the help He continues to give. They press on to fight the remaining of worldliness and unChrist-likeness which they see in themselves, and they don't complain of difficulty anymore: one day their bruises of suffering will be their crown, if they remain faithful. They disregard and set aside all hindrances so they can press on toward their goal.

# Chapter Seventy Two
## The Miracle Comes After Pressing On In Obedience
*Jan 10, 2022*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=214)] 

![](images/214.jpg)

The very first miracle that Jesus did wasn’t a big spectacular thing to heal someone, or to raise someone from the dead.

It was to turn water into wine at a wedding in the town of Cana (John 2).

His mother asked Him to do it, and surprisingly it wasn’t something He did immediately when she asked Him to help. He didn’t just snap His fingers and produce wine right then and there.

This is usually what we’re looking for when we ask the Lord for help, isn’t it? We ask of God and then we want Him to answer immediately in a miraculous, instant way. This is how we would have it all the time.

But that’s not the Lord’s way.

Here, when Jesus turned the water into wine, He told the servants to fill up water into the pots (John 2:6-7). It was A LOT of water into the pots. 20 or 30 Gallons per pot. And there were 6 of these huge pots - so 120-180 gallons total. Have you ever considered all of the hard work the servants had to do before the miracle came? They didn’t have hoses flowing with water back then. Imagine taking an empty gallon-sized jug (the size of a gallon of milk) and dunking it down into a river, filling it up, and carrying it to pour it into a big 20-30 gallon garbage bin-sized container. Until you’ve filled 6 of those bins. So you need to fill that gallon jug, carry and pour it, around, about 150 times!

Of all the miracles Jesus did, this was His first miracle, and it’s amazing that for this He asked so much of people to be part of the work. The One who flooded the earth (and could have filled the buckets Himself with a word), asked these servants to do this work of service first.

But then after that, the great miracle came - the most pure, and best wine that has ever existed.

Jesus didn’t make the wine from nothing - He made it from two things: water, and faithful, persistent obedience. Water which already existed, mixed with the persistent obedience of the servants.

Looking at this story and considering that part of it filled me with hope, and I’ll explain why:

We are all looking to the Lord to do great works in some area. (The Bible says “With difficulty the righteous are saved” (1 Pet 4:18) - so I believe we are all right now looking to the Lord to do some work in some particular difficult area).

God showed me the principle through this: these servants worked hard and long, carrying water and spilling it, maybe straining themselves - but the miracle came ONLY AFTER all of that. The work which I’m looking to God for, usually comes after a period of perseverance, obedience, some suffering and many times with mistakes too. If it feels that the straining and crying to God is there, and the labor is long, but we are still pressing on under God's hand (submitting to His commands, His ways, His timing) - that’s a sign we are on the right track for God to do a great work.

So this picture in my mind of the miracle after the hard work challenged me to press on. The work is hard and may be long but God’s great provision is coming.

When we ask something of the Lord to do some miracle or some work, to turn water into wine into some area of our life - there may be a period of deep diligent pressing on that He asks from us - for example praying consistently for a long time. Or it could be denying our self in some area which is painful for a long time before He does the miracle; resisting Satan, resisting sin. Don’t get discouraged just because He doesn’t do the miracle right away. Be faithful in the meantime and He will provide - He will do it.

Great faith is to God what large diamonds are to men - very rare, but also very precious. I believe that even among Christians, most people stop filling up the buckets half way or less. And so they never see the results of full buckets. They never see wine because they stopped early.

But the servants who will get the wine are the ones who say, "I don't know what He's going to do, but I trust Him. I will keep obeying and filling the pots."

Probably nobody at the wedding noticed these lowly servants carrying ordinary water for all that time, probably unseen, maybe in the back room. The onlookers had no idea what God was doing to set up that miracle.

Be one of those lowly servants who presses on for years or decades, content even if no one sees or notices except for God, and like the wine which no one had ever tasted before - the outcome of your faith and perseverance will be more precious than any you could have imagined. And it says that after the miracle - God manifested His glory, and others believed (John 2:11) through this. Your quiet, load-bearing diligence and obedience is the sign you are on the right path to this, to be part of this work. Press on!


# Chapter Seventy Three
## A Clear Conscience Is Priceless
*Jan 17, 2022*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=217)] 

![](images/217.jpg)

I was really humbled by Paul’s life – how in all his love and in all his service for the Lord, one of the main things that marked his life was, “I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and men” (Acts 24:16).

Yesterday, I was having temptations to not keep a clean conscience. My family and I were out and it was a bit windy where we were at. We were getting into our car in the parking lot and the wind blew my car door open really hard, and then I heard a “Slam!” I looked next to me as I stood there and I thought, “That’s interesting. There’s a really nice car next to me that looks pretty new.” I didn’t think much of it so I got into my car. My conscience was screaming (knowing my door hit the car, and I didn’t want to look), but my flesh was fighting back saying, “Nothing happened!” I looked over and then I saw a mark on the car. Then my flesh was saying, “That mark was already there!” But my conscience was saying “You’re lying to yourself!” I opened my door and the mark was where my door would have hit the car - it was pretty obvious what happened. So this battle was going on in my mind. Then Lord put on my heart: the value of a clean conscience is much more priceless than the value of a car repair. Then temptation #2 came - and that was anxiety. Although the lady who owned the car was kind, after she looked at her car, she didn’t want to just overlook it and leave it (which was my hope). Then I was encouraged by seeing Jesus in Mark 4:37-40: *And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up. Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still.” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm. And He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”*

I was reminded of Hebrews 11:6, “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. ” In other words, if you want to please God, the only way to do it is to have big faith. The way to please God is not to go out and be a missionary, give more money, write more blogs, or speak more sermons. Instead, it is to have a big faith. And big faith can sleep in whatever the storm is in our life. That’s the way that we please God, just like Jesus did. When the temptations come in, we can grab a hold of a word, cling to it and overcome with that word. That’s a great way to glorify God. God’s Word can help us and change us. So I hope to always keep a clean conscience like Paul did and to be holy unto the Lord. This doesn’t mean that we don’t have any sin at all. But for every sin I am aware of, I should not overlook it or argue with my conscience.

I’ve heard this saying: “Beware of arguing with Scripture. Just obey it.” I’m thankful that the Lord is working with us every day, giving us chances to obey our conscience, and to sleep in the storms - and through this we learn to lean on Him.


# Chapter Seventy Four
## Let The Lord Speak To You From His Word
*Mar 18, 2022*
[[link](https://nccf.church/Blog.aspx?BlogID=221)] 

![](images/221.jpg)

**INTRO**

*Hebrews 4:12 "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart."*

Recently I have seen the Lord speak to me some very specific things just through normal, plain and simple Bible reading. They have been such critical words for me, and I've been reminded how important it is to spend time with God in His Word.

We heard on Sunday an exhortation to value and use God's Word, which is our only weapon in our battle against the devil, whose aim is to defeat us in this life to pull us down and away from God, through sin and discouragement.

The Bible says, the Word of God is living and active. What does that mean? I believe the answer to that question decides whether the power God has given in His Word is available to me in my daily life.

**AN ILLUSTRATION**

Here in the U.S., when a family pet - say a beloved cat or a dog passes away, many times the family gets that pet cremated and stored in a wooden box with that pet's name on the box. They may bury it in the yard, or they may even put it on a shelf as a reminder of the good memories and the part of the family it was.

Before the pet passed away - the family pets the animal; they play with it, they feed it, they talk to it, they listen for it. But after it passes away and the pet is cremated and put into that box; they don't go and interact with the pet anymore. The box sits there as a memory.

What’s The difference between a living pet and one which is not living? INTERACTION

**A CURRENTLY LIVING WORD**

It's the same with the Word of God. It is part of my life TODAY, and it speaks to my need today, and it has real answers for my real temptations and sins and problems today. I don't look to "learn facts", but I look to God to speak to ME through it for things that are going on with me currently. It directs me and tells me which way to go and encourages me along the way - because it's really God speaking to me directing me and lifting me. I appreciate the Holy Spirit speaking to me, which He does - but He speaks through His Word, and the written Word first; so I can tell which His voice is. There's A LOT of voices we hear everyday (our flesh, our feelings, the devil, the world), and we have to know which one is really of God.

2 Peter 1:18-20 says the "most sure voice" is Scripture - God's written Word. And it says that it's more sure than any voice thundering even if we hear it from heaven.

I heard a phrase, "Why do you need a voice when you have a verse?" God has mainly spoken through His Word first, and from that as the foundation the Spirit can speak to me:

*John 14:26 "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you."*

There's no command in Scripture that we have to read the Bible every day. But I think having that as a general goal and discipline (even just reading a little bit - without being condemned if we miss a day) is a really good goal to have - because it opens up the opportunity for God to speak to me from His Word, and speak to me words that I need.

I have a sin or struggle or issue, some worry or temptation - and I read God's Word or, listen to a message, etc - I come to it and I EXPECT the Lord CAN AND HAS TO give me something for my situation. And so I read expecting Him to help me - LOOKING for His voice to me in there, to guide me, to convict me - for God to talk to me.

This is the INTERACTION that makes God's Word *living* to me.

I’ve seen God regularly give me Words I need through just reading the Bible; not any formal studying of it necessarily - just reading through it, like a cow grazing grass eating little by little. And I can testify - His word is LIVING. It’s not just for yesterday, or tomorrow. God sees into my life, all intimate details no one knows, and He speaks through His Word. And then I get a new course of action, or mind or attitude or encouragement on something that no one else could give me because nobody knows my situation like God does.

That’s what living means - I interact with it TODAY. It’s not on the shelf collecting dust like a box with ashes of a pet that passed away. Every day we have needs. When you come to God's Word - come expecting He will say something that you need. Keep your eyes open. Say, “Speak, Lord, I'm listening.” The default for most people is - bottle everything in, or call some friend, or hire a therapist, or search for answers on the internet - ANYTHING but God's Word!! That’s because most see God's Word as dead, not living - "Someone ELSE has my answers."

**CHALLENGING EXAMPLES**

One question that has sometimes come to my mind is; "What about all the saints who had no Bible, like those for 1500 years after Jesus, before the printing press was invented?"

I believe the real question is what we do with the Word we have. Not every faithful Christian has had a Bible. But whoever the true saints are - I know that they've clung to that Word which they did have, and devoted themselves to it, and studied it, and lived by it, and looked for God in it. One example I saw recently was not only before the printing press was invented, but it was actually before the New Testament was even written! - Timothy's mother (and grandmother) had enough of God's Word to teach Timothy and ground him in it, and it resulted in his salvation - and she didn't even have the New Testament!! We read about this in 2 Timothy chapters 1 together with chapter 3:

*2 Tim 1:5 "For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well."*

*....*

*2 Tim 3:15 "... from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. "*

Timothy's Mom was devoted to God's Word, and passed that on to her son - an incomplete Bible. It was God's Word, but it wasn't finished yet - and it was still able to save BECAUSE OF HER ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD'S WORD. I know many faithful, godly Christians had no Bibles at home. But I know that whatever Scripture they did have, they treasured it. And if they did have a Bible, they would have treasured that.

I was also challenged by the story of a young girl named "Mary Jones" who lived in the 1700 and 1800s, and worked from the age of 10 for SIX YEARS, working odd jobs to earn money, teaching herself to read, and then going on a dangerous journey 26 miles long, barefoot, to buy a Bible for herself, which she kept for her lifetime. Her story inspired a man to start a foundation for Bible translation, production and distribution (the British Bible Society), which still exists today. I'm humbled by the zeal this little girl had for God's Word.

Lastly, I also remember what it says of Paul as he was going about his Christian life and ministry:

*Acts 18:5 "But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."*

Paul devoted himself to God‘s Word.

So I’m challenged by his example, and many faithful before - many who had no Bibles, but were zealous for God's written Word, and clung to what they had for their daily life. I want to feed off of Scripture regularly to change my life and bless others and, and I expect the Lord to speak to me for my specific situations from it.
