## Luke'S Love For Theophilus

I was encouraged reading just the first view verses of the book of Luke:

Luke 1:3 *“It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; 4 so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught”*

Luke loved this brother Theophilus so much that he took the time to write the whole book of Luke, just for this one brother to know exactly what he'd been taught. He even went on to write another whole book for him (Acts 1:1)! Apparently Theophilus was a brother who already believed, but Luke wanted to strengthen his faith. It must have taken a long time to write these books, and Luke was a physician - a very profitable and helpful job. But he disregarded the time it would take and all the things he could have been doing in the meantime, and took these pains even for this one brother. Theophilus already believed, couldn’t Luke have written to many unbelievers, saving many of the lost? He could have, but that was not the burden God gave him. He had an intense love for his brother that God put in his heart (as He does when He gives us the Holy Spirit - Romans 5:5), and so he took the time to write these things for him.

When I think of what it means to build the church I often think of 'wide' ministry, which reaches many people all at once (like preaching and teaching). But the heart of God is one which is willing to take great pains even for a single one (like a shepherd leaving 99 sheep to go after 1 lost sheep – which, by the way Luke happened to write about! – Luke 15:3-7). Praise God He did that for us, having that 'narrow' burden for us. I hope to have that heart too. Any time we are overwhelmed with thoughts of "I'm not doing enough for the church", I'm encouraged to look and see - am I at least doing something for somebody out of care for them? God never called us to be everything to everyone, only to take the one or few burdens at a time He has for us, to help carry another person through.

We can’t be aware of all the needs in the church, but can we be aware of at least one need of someone else and commit to pray for it, to check in with them and see how they're doing? I think anybody can do that. And the Lord has made it very simple for us, that we can focus on those few burdens carefully, giving 'quality', not 'quantity' to the church. Giving ourselves *fully* somewhere, not *a little bit* of ourselves everywhere. And the beauty of the church is, if everyone is tending to their few burdens carefully, the Holy Spirit will coordinate so that *all* the needs in the church are met (Ephesians 4:16). But if I'm not faithful with the little God has given me, then someone else may be missing out until God calls another to take on what I should have been doing. Luke is an outstanding example of a man who took extreme pains for one other brother, and his faithfulness has gone on (he never knew it would) to bless millions of others for two thousand years since then. Luke is an amazing example for us to follow in the heart and love of God in building the church.
